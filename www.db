191	ee46f10b-4232-4125-86a7-c9b45f6ec115	Shared Governance	<p><strong>Shared Governance</strong> is Salt Lake City School District&rsquo;s process for participatory decision-making. Although it is the exclusive right of the Board of Education to determine the goals and direction of the district, in 1974, the Salt Lake Board of Education agreed to delegate the right to local sites to make some decisions through the use of the Shared Governance process. Shared Governance is based on the philosophy that education is a responsibility of all employees and the community, and that when people work together to make decisions, many advantages accrue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shared Governance is deeply embedded in the district&rsquo;s culture. Under Shared Governance, district personnel and, at the school level, members of the community join to make decisions which affect the welfare of students and education. Shared Governance allows for a broad range of decisions, but all decisions must fit within the law, Board of Education policies, budgets, and professional ethics requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shared Governance creates a sense of ownership and can empower participants to achieve great things. When people believe that what they think, say, and do make a difference, they feel a sense of pride in what they accomplish. Participation in decisions helps improve employee performance and success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Six Basic Principles</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Six basic principles</strong> are common to all: delegation, openness, trust and equity, decision-making, review and adjudication, accountability, and dialogue and communication. Delegation means that the Salt Lake City Board of Education delegates some decisions to be made by stakeholders at school positive relationships. Participants should feel empowered to speak freely without fear of consequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When making decisions using Shared Governance, groups should strive to make decisions by reaching <strong>consensus</strong>. This does not mean that 100 percent of the group is in perfect agreement. It means that all members agree to support the best decision that can be made at the time. However, sometimes consensus cannot be reached, yet a decision must be made. In these rare instances, groups may request assistance from the district&rsquo;s chief executive officer, the Superintendent.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Accountability</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Accountability</strong> means that after a decision is made all stakeholders are expected to support that decision and to help make its implementation successful. With regular dialogue and communication, good decisions can be reached and openness and trust will flourish among group members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The practice of Shared Governance does not look the same in every context, and many different types of decisions are made at schools and by departments every day. In some cases &ndash; especially in matters of law, policy, regulation, or safety &ndash; decisions may be made with limited participation. In these cases, the decision-maker should then communicate and explain the decision and rationale to stakeholders. In other contexts, decision-makers may be able to involve individuals or groups in the decision-making process. Others may be consulted with, listened to, asked for their reactions, or given a chance to be heard before a decision is made or even help make the final decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participatory decision-making exists only in an atmosphere where members can speak their minds without fear of coercion, ridicule, or retribution and where all points of view are equally considered. That is what Shared Governance is all about. The Salt Lake City Board of Education recognizes that a school district is a complex organization and believes that everyone&rsquo;s ideas are important.</p>	\N	\N	f	2017-08-09 13:50:08.107-06	2017-08-15 14:11:34.654-06	t	\N	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

910	930c3e7d-5692-4092-9862-f47dfd3f8210	Author Shannon Hale Visits Bryant 	<p>Last month, author and Bryant alumnus, Shannon Hale spoke to students at Bryant Middle School.  Hale is the best-selling author of fifteen children’s and young adult novels, including the <em>Ever After High</em> series, <em>The Goose Girl</em> series, <em>The Princess Academy</em> series, and <em>Book of a Thousand Days</em>.  She has also co-authored the graphic novels <em>Rapunzel’s Revenge</em> and <em>Calamity Jack</em> with her husband Dean Hale.  Hale is the only Utah author to ever have received a Newbery Medal or Honor which she received for Newbery Honor winner <em>The Princess Academy </em>in 2006.</p>\n<p>At Bryant Middle School, having authors visit the school is a critical component to developing students who are readers and writers.  Emily DeJong, the librarian at Bryant Middle School, said “We are so proud to have an author of Shannon Hale’s caliber that was a student at Bryant Middle School.  Our students are going to hear from Shannon and see what she has been able to accomplish in her life and know that with dedication and hard work that they can accomplish great things in their lives as well.”</p>\n<p>Hale talked to students about the rejection that she faced as she began her writing career.  She said she continued to write because, “I didn’t want to get to an age and look back and say, ‘What if?’ I wanted to spend my time doing what I love.”  She described how when she writes a novel she focuses on “world building” and thinks about what the culture of the characters and society will be, what they will wear, what they will eat. </p>\n<p>Hale said that often boys think they can’t read her book <em>The Princess Academy</em> because of the word “Princess” in the title and encouraged them not to limit themselves by thinking something is “for girls.”  She showed pictures of famous male authors and boys reading <em>The Princess Academy</em> including Jon Scieszka and James Dashner.  To become better writers she advised them to “read, allow yourself to daydream, think, question, try new things.”  She finished by telling students not to write what they know, but to write what fascinates them. </p>\n	<p>Last month, author and Bryant alumnus, Shannon Hale spoke to students at Bryant Middle School.</p>\n	f	2016-11-04 10:12:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:06.266745-06	2017-09-19 13:10:36.673064-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Sixth-grade teachers Mr. Burkley, Mr. Arthur, and Mr. Shultz prepared themselves by donning trash bags and then brought the students together to teach an action packed lesson on ratios. The lesson started with a ratio of 8 raw eggs to 10 boiled eggs. A handful of lucky students got to smash eggs on their teachers’ heads while others kept track of the ratio of raw to boiled eggs as the game progressed. The odds did not favor the teachers! Meadowlark is thrilled to have such amazing students and staff, and we look forward to more fun, engaging learning experiences throughout the year. </p>\n<p>You can check out videos from the lesson on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MeadowlarkSLC/">Meadowlark’s Facebook page</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Keenan Burkely, Meadowlark Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>Equipped with clipboards, pencils, and a carton of eggs, Meadowlark fifth and sixth graders braced themselves for their first math lesson of the year!

The event brought out parents, volunteers, and the school staff to support the students as they ran around the playground for an hour straight.</p>\n<p>The March for Microbes run allows students to raise money for a science program called Sci-X and a science specialist at the school. Students first set goals for the number of laps they intended to run and got pledges to support their efforts.</p>\n<p>With the money raised from March for Microbes and with the Sci-X program, students are able to attend a monthly science lab. In this lab, students participate in hands-on experiments reemphasizing science units studied in class. Parents are welcome to support and assist these science labs and help students experiment with hands-on learning.</p>\n<p>The Sci-X program also helps students and teachers to learn and embrace a new era of science learning called “3 dimensional science.” The intention of these new science standards is to have students use tools to create their own learning and allow more discovery to understand science facts. Students are intended to learn through hands-on discovery, experimentation, trial and error, comparing and contrasting, developing and using models, among others.</p>\n	<p>Kindergarten through sixth graders all took to the Beacon Heights playground to run laps and earn pledges in their annual race called “March for Microbes.”</p>\n	f	2016-11-02 15:48:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:06.342711-06	2017-09-19 13:10:36.879717-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

He also won the Hornbook Award and was the presenter of a famous Ted Talk about creative writing. Some titles include “Extra Yarn”, “Billy Twitters and His Blue Whale Problem” and “Sam and Dave Dig a Hole.”</p>\n<p>Barnett, who is currently on tour to promote his new book “How This Book Was Made,” told the students at Beacon Heights stories of the process of writing, editing, and revising his books. All of these stories were included in his most recent book.</p>\n<p>The students laughed and cheered as Barnett entertained them with not-exactly-true and overly exaggerated accounts of the process it takes to make a book. Some of which included stories about barges full of books getting hijacked by pirates and pigeons flying away with his books.</p>\n<p>Although Barnett humorously exaggerated stories of the writing process, students came away from the presentation understanding a little more about the importance of editing and revising their writing. Teachers at Beacon Heights used Barnett’s star power to emphasize and support their writing lessons and to show the importance of revising and editing their work. Because of the stories in the book, students understood the painstaking process it can be to make a final finished piece of writing.</p>\n	<p>Beacon Heights Elementary students learned about the writing process from well known children’s author Mac Barnett.</p>\n	f	2016-10-28 09:17:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:06.808857-06	2017-09-19 13:10:37.892191-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

It is a place where plump pumpkins grow on vines, ruby red tomatoes and bright orange carrots are plucked by smiling students and the scent of basil and other herbs calms even the most distraught student. Backman’s secret garden was funded by a grant written by science teacher Gretchen Klinger but has been a true community collaboration. Community volunteers built the three beds that make up the garden, students and teachers planted pumpkin, pepper, carrot, squash, lettuce, cucumber and tomato plants and dedicated staff kept the garden going over the summer. </p>\n<p>Greg Pope, a community member and paraprofessional at Backman, cared for the garden over the break. “I watered all of the plants most every day, pulled weeds, made sure each plant got the individual care it needed and harvested,” said Pope. </p>\n<p>As a result of this work, the garden was flourishing when students came back to school. Students and families explored the garden during Back to School night, munching on ice cream as they checked out the plants. But the garden is a tool that staff uses all year long. </p>\n<p>Principal Heather Newell says the garden holds magic for students who need a calm place. “Kids who are struggling for whatever reason, calm down as soon as they smell a fresh basil leaf, touch a ripening tomato or find a maturing pumpkin among the vines. I have been able to reach some of our hardest students as soon as their attention turns to our school garden and away from whatever is troubling them for the moment,” said Newell </p>\n<p>Klinger, the science teacher who wrote the grant, said the garden is a great teaching tool as well. “It allows students to use their 5 senses in a hands-on application. They are able to see the life cycles of plants, see how soil, water, air, and a little love help them grow and investigate the parts of plants, harvest seeds and, hopefully, see pollination happening. </p>\n<p>Although the garden has been prepared for winter, the Backman team has plans to help this garden grow, including a grant request for a greenhouse structure that would allow staff and students to enjoy the magic of the garden all year long.</p>\n	<p>There is a magical place at Backman Elementary, tucked in the shadows of the science classrooms. It is a place where plump pumpkins grow on vines, ruby red tomatoes and bright orange carrots are plucked by smiling students and the scent of basil and other herbs calms even the most distraught student.</p>	f	2016-12-28 15:58:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:52.71196-06	2017-09-19 13:10:11.690958-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

From there we went straight into science.</p>\n<p>As a fourth grade class we checked NASA’s website and had a constant video stream going of the solar eclipse in the areas of complete totality. We also read a few articles about what a solar eclipse is and we started watching the dimming light out the window. It didn’t take long to find out that the students had a lot of background knowledge about the eclipse. It was obviously a topic that had been discussed at home and that made learning about it in class, more of a discussion then a lesson. The students couldn’t wait to go outside to see the eclipse for themselves.</p>\n<p>At Uintah we are very lucky to have an amazing principal who made sure that we had the proper solar eye wear, in order to safely view the eclipse. After learning about how to be safe we went outside to check it out! Students, teachers, and parents alike stood in awe watching the eclipse. It was a once in a lifetime sight for many of us. Even though we didn’t get to see the entire sun become covered, we still got to see an amazing solar event. We noticed how quiet it got when the eclipse started and how amazing the dusk-like lighting was. The eclipse made for a very memorable first day of school and it gave us a great start to fourth grade!</p>\n<p><em>Author: Macy Ostrom, Uintah Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>The first day of school started out with the usual meeting of students and parents, welcoming students to their new classroom and grade, and letting everyone get to know each other.

But on a bigger scale, do we ever talk about how one or more friendly faces can change a student’s entire year? Being a volunteer family or student for our brave refugee students as part of the first year of the Family to Family program at Clayton Middle School definitely changed my year. It has taught me, first of all, unforgettably important principles to being a friend in general. Second of all, it has encouraged me to become close friends with someone I might not otherwise get to know. But most of all- and the most important thing I took away from this experience- was that I realized and became even more amazed with how much we can learn from these courageous families. While their experiences help us become more aware of how hard some people have to endure, these refugee students also show us through their example that we can do hard things and that although we may struggle, we can make it through. </p>\n<p>One of the many great things I learned last year was how to portray the qualities and principles of a longtime friend to basically a complete stranger. Even for me, who had an easy time making friends since I could talk, this was a real struggle. I remember the first time that my family to family friend, Hteh, and I met. We talked for a while just trying to get to know each other but it was even awkward for me. As time went on, we both came much more comfortable with each other, which I think is one of the most amazing things about the process- getting to know each other better and becoming more comfortable with each other as you put more effort into your relationship. It was crazy feeling that searching for any kindness and friendly feelings that you have and putting them into that person to make them feel welcome and wanted. Even seeing each other in the halls between classes got more exciting as we got to know each other. This part of our developing relationship was definitely one of my favorite parts by far. </p>\n<p>Secondly, this program encourages others, and definitely me, to put an extra effort into a relationship with someone you might not usually put that effort into. Along with helping Hteh by providing a friendly face around the school, it also helped me realize how many students there are who need a friend. This amazing program taught me, among many things, the vitality of being a friend of any sort and now it can change other’s personalities along with mine. For example, I noticed that after I started talking to Hteh more, whenever I was walking down the hall with one of my friends, they would become friendlier to her over time as well. Same thing with her friends and me. Whenever we saw each other in classes or in the hall, they would be even friendlier to me than before. In general, her friends became a lot more friendly to me and mine with hers. If this doesn’t show how this can change an entire school or even community, then I don’t know what does. </p>\n<p>Finally, I have learned so much from and about these people and their close knit communities and families. This amount is honestly more than I could ever talk about or write about. From Hteh and her family, I have learned so many things from respect and bravery, to simply how to do a specific math problem. One time around the end of the school year last year, Hteh and her family came over to my house to have dinner with my family. It was amazing to see Hteh translate between the two families and how respectful and wonderfully polite her family was to ours. I remember how selfless they were that night and how they literally did not ask for a thing. We were all sitting in our living room talking about their journey to the U.S. and I was constantly thinking how hard it must have been moving from place to place all over the country, starting over in each and every one of those places. I guarantee we could all learn a few lessons from them on kindness, courage, bravery, and persistence. All of the refugee students in our school’s program have the biggest hearts full of thoughtfulness, wisdom, experience, and kindness. They are some of the greatest people on this earth. </p>\n<p>If I had to summarize my experiences from last year along with the things I have learned while participating in the program, the one word I would use is unforgettable. These people’s personalities and hearts are some of the biggest in the world. I would not change any one of my experiences-even if they were awkward- one bit because of the things they have taught me.

By Asking Questions	<p>Discovery Gateway visited Ensign Elementary's kindergarten classes this September and introduced us to hands-on experiences in energy. We learned that pushing and pulling is force. What happened to the energy from our bodies as we pushed? Even though we can’t see force, we can see the effect of force. Our objects moved in the direction of our force when we pushed or pulled.</p>\n<p>Why not extend our thinking? What happens if the object is tethered to a single point? We had fun playing with hover discs, pushing them and watching the effects of our push. In addition, we challenged our intuitive understanding of force by simultaneously rolling a big ball and a little ball down a ramp. Energy is fundamental in science, and kindergarten is an engaging place to explore such questions and answers.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Stephanie Bauman, Ensign Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>Discovery Gateway visited Ensign Elementary's kindergarten classes this September and introduced us to hands-on experiences in energy.

The district’s Child Nutrition Department selected Backman Elementary, Meadowlark Elementary, Mountain View Elementary, and Riley Elementary to participate in this program, based on the level of need among their students.  All students who attend these schools, regardless of income level, are eligible to receive one free breakfast each day they attend school.</p>\n<p>Traditional school breakfast programs can sometimes operate too early for students to participate, particularly if bus or carpool schedules do not allow them to get to the school on time. Breakfast in the Classroom is an innovative, proven approach to successfully expand access to school breakfast by allowing students to eat breakfast in their classroom after the official start of the school day. Breakfast in the Classroom typically takes 10–15 minutes and can happen during morning tasks such as attendance, or it can be integrated with other instructional activities.</p>\n<p>“The old adage that breakfast is the most important meal of the day is still true,” said Kelly Orton, Salt Lake City School District Child Nutrition Director. “Children who eat a healthy breakfast perform better in school, and this program is helping boost participation in the school breakfast program for some of our neediest students. The four schools are already seeing a tremendous increase in the number of students eating school breakfast. In three of the four schools, the number of students has more than doubled. “ </p>\n<p>Studies show that students who skip breakfast generally have slower memory recall and make more errors. Students who eat breakfast consistently show improvement in verbal fluency, arithmetic, tests of attention, memory, creativity, physical endurance, and general tests of academic achievement and cognitive functioning. Research also shows that universal school breakfast program participation is associated with higher rates of attendance and declines in tardiness.</p>\n<p>The program began in the four schools at the first of this month as a pilot program to test its effectiveness. Next year, a total of 17 Salt Lake City schools will have the opportunity to participate in Breakfast in the Classroom.</p>\n	<p>Students in four Salt Lake City schools now have the opportunity to eat school breakfast in their classrooms.</p>\n	f	2016-04-19 10:50:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:12.132644-06	2017-09-19 13:10:49.482006-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Students and staff were treated to a special presentation by not one, but two, bestselling authors, Alexandra Bracken and Tamara Ireland Stone. The pair are on tour to promote their newest books. After a brief introduction, students engaged in a trivia game followed by a question-and-answer session, during which they learned about the authors’ previous careers, favorite and least favorite things about being writers, life events, and, of course, their work. Requests for books by Bracken and Stone have been nonstop since the assembly.</p>\n<p>Alex Bracken is the author of nine books, including <em>The Darkest Minds </em>trilogy, which is set to be released as a movie in 2018. She describes her newest book, <em>The Dreadful Tale of Prosper Redding</em>, in just three words: <em>Halloween</em>. <em>Magic</em>. <em>Family</em>. In this story, a demon, who Bracken says is “snarky, as most demons are” wants to take revenge on young Prosper for a betrayal by his great-great (x5) grandfather. The book has been described as “darkly delicious” and “occasionally frightening.” Bracken admits to liking “dark, sad things,” but she assured students that this book is not <em>too </em>scary. A second book about Prosper is already in progress.</p>\n<p>Tamara Ireland Stone has written “timebending” romance stories and realistic books about serious topics such as OCD. In her new book, <em>Click’d</em>, she explores the consequences of social media and apps that are launched before they have been perfected. Readers of <em>Click’d</em> will be treated to a riveting story and might even be inspired to try to make their own apps or learn about coding. With Stone’s background in technology-- she used to work with Steve Jobs-- she’s able to explain “technology stuff” in a fun, accessible way.</p>\n<p>It was an honor to host these two authors and Bryant is grateful to them for coming all the way from California (Stone) and Arizona (Bracken) to share part of their morning with us. Students went away inspired to try their own hand at writing, and they can’t wait for the Bracken/Stone books to become a part of our library collection.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Terry Thomas, Bryant Middle School</em></p>\n	<p>Wednesday, September 13, was a great day to be a Bryant Middle School Bobcat!

Though the season brought the chilly days and snow-filled nights with it, the warmth from our dear Leopards’ hearts shined through in many different ways throughout the whole month of November.</p>\n<p>A group of awesome faculty members attended an AVID-based training earlier in the year. During this month, East staff and administration gathered once again together to learn about and put into practice some useful, cross-curricular strategies. The activities were dynamic and they certainly set the tone for team success.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest and most prideful events was the win of our EHS football team, making them State Champions for two years in a row! Rice-Eccles stadium filled up by kick-off and the Leopards took on their last football game of the year like the great and fierce team they have shown to be. The Leopards defeated Springville 48-20! The players were very thankful to the fans, the community who went to support them and the coaching staff who trained them all season long. The whole school thanks the team for being a fine example of unity and dedication.   </p>\n<p>The team success didn’t quite end there though. Our East High Theater Department put together a fabulous production of High School Musical  and it sold-out every single show! The cast, the dances, and the music were all amazing! Our East thespians certainly outdid themselves with this play. There were people who traveled from out of state just to experience HSM at the one and only East High School. One of these people was KayCee Stroh, the actress who played Martha in the original HSM movie. What an honor for the Leopards to receive such acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>The showcase of talents doesn’t stop there. The City Library proudly showcased projects from the East High 9<sup>th</sup> Annual Photo Exhibit from November 9 to December 18. The wonderful pictures from our aspiring Leopard photographers are simply a great way to appreciate art through a camera lens. Their teacher, Mr. Frank Langheinrich, thanks everyone and anyone who went to support his talented students. </p>\n<p>And lastly, East High staff showed us once again that they are just awesome examples for the students and the community as a whole. On the Tuesday before Thanksgiving break, many teachers came out to the school’s entrances at 7 a.m. to greet and thank students on their way into the building. The faculty came up with this idea of appreciating every single student at East High in hopes to lift up everyone’s mood and inspire a thankful mindset before the holidays. Different media coverage can be found online regarding this marvelous event. It definitely was a Thankful Tuesday for the Leopards.</p>\n	<p>Last month made itself known with its drastic weather change.

Did you know that collectively Emerson’s current teachers have taught 528 years? That’s a lot of knowledge and experience in one building! As part of this year’s school improvement plan, Emerson Eagles are being mindful. Teachers are working to create mindful classrooms for their students as well as mindful practices as the chaos of teaching starts.</p>\n<p>Teachers have been discussing mindful habits as part of their weekly staff meetings lead by Josh Craner, a sixth-grade teacher at Emerson. In their last meeting they learned the leadership manifesto by Brenē Brown.</p>\n<p>“We want to show up, we want to learn, and we want to inspire. We are hardwired for connection, curiosity, and engagement. We crave purpose, and we have a deep desire to create and contribute. We want to take risks, embrace our vulnerabilities, and be courageous. When learning and working are dehumanized- when you no longer see us and no longer encourage our daring, or when you only see what we produce or how we perform- we disengage and turn away from the very things that the world needs from us: Our talent, our ideas, and our passion. What we ask is that you engage with us, show up beside us, and learn from us. Feedback is a function of respect; when you don’t have honest conversations with us about our strengths and our opportunities for growth, we question our contributions and your commitment. Above all else, we ask that you show up, let yourself be seen, and be courageous. Dare greatly with us.”</p>\n<p>Teachers have shown up. They have created purposeful, engaging learning opportunities and inspired their students in just the first week. Teachers and staff will collaborate all year to bring mindfulness to themselves and the students they inspire. Imagine with 528 years of experience how truly great this year at Emerson will be!</p>\n<p><em>Author: Summer Pelton, Emerson Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>Students, faculty, and staff are starting the year out with mindfulness!

We’ve had an eventful first week of school, starting with the first day. As you know, there was a solar eclipse on Monday, August 21, 2017. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun. The moon blocks the light of the sun and a shadow of the moon is cast on Earth’s surface. Because we are not in the path of totality, we were only able to see a partial eclipse.</p>\n<p>Thanks to our science teacher, Ms. Gummow, every student had a pair of eclipse glasses, and we were able to watch the eclipse together. Many students were excited about what they saw. It got slightly darker outside, and a little bit colder as well. The sun looked as if the moon had taken a bite out of it. After the eclipse, teachers took time to debrief their students and talk about what they experienced. It was an unforgettable, once in a lifetime opportunity, and we’re so glad we got to share it with our students.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Aly Miller, Parkview Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>Welcome back to school from Parkview Elementary! We are so excited to be back at Parkview with our students to start off the 2017-18 school year.

The event opened with a general session where parents were presented with research on the learning regression student’s face after a summer break.</p>\n<p>Once parents had the statistics, they were given tools to help their students. A variety of breakout sessions included strategies for reading aloud to children, from infancy through the teenage years. There was instruction on continuing math and literacy skills at home with online programs such as ST Math and Lexia Reading. A make and take session provided math fact games to play over the summer and a list of everyday math activities, even while pumping gas, to reinforce basic math skills.</p>\n<p>Research shows that students who read over the summer maintain their academic standing better than those who do not, the students were challenged to read at least six books over the break. To facilitate this goal, a representative from the public library informed parents about their summer reading program and make sure everyone has a library card. They also provided free books to help students get a head start on their reading.</p>\n<p>As they left, the parents commented on how well the information prepared them to take a larger academic role over the summer.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Avan Thayn, Bennion Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>The focus of the literacy night at Bennion Elementary was academic maintenance.

The students learned what it was like to use both your feet and arms to control an airplane, they learned about how music is a very important part of one’s life. A banker described how taking care of other people’s money is important and how one can become a banker. A long haul trucking company explained how food is transported to the stores in refrigerated trucks. Two engineers talked about their jobs of creating and constructing the billboards the students see along the freeway.  </p>\n<p>It can be difficult to keep the students engaged while listening to the volunteers explain their jobs. A catapult, therapy dog and model airplanes helped with that engagement. We love our volunteers who spend time each year encouraging students to work hard and stay in school.</p>\n	<p>STAY IN SCHOOL!

Approximately 260 students participated.</p>\n<p>One group of 25 students visited the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art under the guidance of educators Paul Hetzel, Wendy Miller, Jennifer Quintanna, and Amelia Degraffenried. During this visit, students saw and engaged with a 3-D contemporary art exhibit.  Students learned that contemporary artists present different areas of a current concept or issue and then allow the audience to interpret the issue for themselves.  Students had the opportunity to apply what they learned about the concepts of contemporary art by crafting a piece of art.  They kept their pieces to remember the experience and share with their families.</p>\n<p>Tracy Aviary was the destination for another one of the four field trips. Educators Jill Littlefield, Rodregis Smith, Lorrie Orton, Becky Stewart, Jillana Butler, Manuel Gallegos, Natosha Washington, and Angela Elegante along with counselors Tra’cee Brothers, Jeffrey Lutz, and Julia Schleifman divided approximately 110 students into smaller groups.  Some groups explored the grounds while others participated in a learning activity with the venue’s staff.  Students saw exotic birds up close; learned about the birds’ specific habitats; identified bird skeletons, eggs, and wings; and learned about how birds adapt to their environments. Students observed pelicans, condors, hornbills, and macaws as well as a myriad of smaller birds all in their natural habitats. Art teacher Jillana Butler gave drawing pads to her student group who used their skills of observation to sketch the birds they encountered.  Career and Technical Education teacher Jill Littlefield’s student group took pictures with IPads to record the trip’s events. Students had fun feeding the ducks and enjoyed seeing the peacocks roam the grounds.</p>\n<p>Educators Javier Viana and Luke Shroyer and 12 students visited Park City’s National Ability Center.  The students participated in a challenging ropes course to build confidence and communication skills as well as to encourage teamwork during adverse situations.  Although the students were at first intimidated by the three-story apparatus consisting of long ropes and platforms, they continued to encourage each other until all had finished the course.  At the end of the afternoon, Viana and Shroyer overheard many of the students saying, “This is the coolest thing I’ve ever done!”</p>\n<p>English Language Development teachers Angela Elegante and Nathan Tanner along with counselors Jeffrey Lutz and Julia Schleifman took 110 students to the University of Utah to see what a college campus is like.  The group visited several academic departments. In the Chemistry Department, students participated in a lab and made bouncy balls while learning about polymers and monomers.  Students visited an engineering class and learned how forces—such as speed and temperature—affect various materials.  Students learned the four elements of dance when visiting a dance class.  While walking throughout the campus, students participated in a scavenger hunt provided by the campus’ LEAP organization.  Students took a picture of each location or item found. The students learned a college campus is a big place—they walked over two miles during their exploration! Students will sign an education pledge and will receive a diploma in the spring.  LEAP sponsored the field trip. The LEAP organization exists to support students who make the “leap” from high school to college.</p>\n<p>  Normal<br />\n  0</p>\n<p>  false<br />\n  false<br />\n  false</p>\n<p>  EN-US<br />\n  X-NONE<br />\n  X-NONE</p>\n<p> /* Style Definitions */<br />\ntable.MsoNormalTable<br />\n\t{mso-style-name:"Table Normal";<br />\n\tmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;<br />\n\tmso-tstyle-colband-size:0;<br />\n\tmso-style-noshow:yes;<br />\n\tmso-style-priority:99;<br />\n\tmso-style-parent:"";<br />\n\tmso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;<br />\n\tmso-para-margin-top:0in;<br />\n\tmso-para-margin-right:0in;<br />\n\tmso-para-margin-bottom:8.0pt;<br />\n\tmso-para-margin-left:0in;<br />\n\tline-height:107%;<br />\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;<br />\n\tfont-size:11.0pt;<br />\n\tfont-family:Calibri;<br />\n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;<br />\n\tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;<br />\n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;<br />\n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;}</p>\n\n	<p>This year at Northwest Middle School, 17 interdisciplinary teachers are planning various field trip opportunities to extend student learning outside the walls of the classroom.  According to research, field trips have a positive impact on students’ cognitive skills, knowledge, interests, and future career choices.  Additionally, field trips increase student understanding and knowledge about the</p>	f	2016-12-14 13:03:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:55.428638-06	2017-09-19 13:10:17.279691-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Adjusting to the extra noise and limited playground space was rewarded last week when staff and School Community Council members were invited for a peek inside the new Liberty Elementary. Major changes on the outside – big windows, beautiful metal siding, stripes on the parking lot had piqued everyone’s curiosity. But seeing the inside of the building had everyone’s jaws on the floor.</p>\n<p>The building has a beautiful front office with thoughtful details, a grand staircase with light streaming in, a large library overlooking the Wasatch Range, and bright, modern classrooms. The teachers were impressed with the amount of storage, light, and space in their rooms. The Community Council members loved the wall of windows in the cafeteria and the beautiful music and art rooms, as well as the large auditorium. Everyone is excited to start the 2017-2018 school year in this lovely, welcoming space.</p>\n<p>The lights will go out at Lincoln Elementary in June and Liberty Elementary will open its doors in August. The new Liberty Elementary will not only be one of the only schools to receive all new furniture, but will also house a state-of-the-art community clinic funded by a $3 million grant from the Ray and Tye Noorda Foundation. The clinic will provide health, dental, and vision care for students and community members.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Anna Kogan, Lincoln Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>For the past year, Lincoln Elementary students, staff, and parents have been eagerly watching the progress on the construction site next door.

Teachers were able to instruct the students prior to the start of the eclipse. Classes went outside and had great discussions while viewing the eclipse. We even had a lot of parents come to volunteer at school to help with the younger ones, making sure that they were not looking directly at the sun without using the viewers. “</p>\n<p>One student exclaimed while making an observation, “I can’t tell which is the sun or which is the moon because the sun looks like the shape the moon usually looks like.”</p>\n<p>Another student joined in on the conversation stating he found it interesting that it “didn’t get as dark as I thought it would.”</p>\n<p>There were a lot of “this is way cool” and “I didn’t realize that it would look like that” comments too. Students from older grades even chimed in by talking about the differences between lunar and solar eclipses.</p>\n<p>Sixth-grade teacher Mary Taylor said the orbit of the moon is part of the sixth-grade science curriculum, “To be able to experience such a vivid representation of motion in the solar system was priceless. The students are then able to take this experience and relate it to what is taught in the classroom." </p>\n<p>“We teach phenomena in science. Having a solar eclipse is a phenomenon that we don’t see everyday. For some people it will be once in a lifetime opportunity they will see and remember,” said Paula Marquez, fifth-grade teacher. “This is a great way to begin a year and to start off our science core with such an intriguing experience.”</p>\n<p><em>Author: Staci Rodriguez, Highland Park Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>The excitement of the first day of school on was increased due to the fact that Salt Lake City was going to have a natural phenomenon occur during recess – the Great Solar Eclipse of 2017.</p>	f	2017-08-23 12:00:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:24:23.22693-06	2017-09-19 13:09:10.209861-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Salt Lake City School District has leased the goats to handle the weeds and brush on the steep hillside behind the school. The small herd from 4 Leaf Ranch is an environmentally friendly alternative for eliminating cheat grass and other plants that have overtaken the hillside.</p>\n<p>The sure-footed goats can handle the steep hills, are better for the environment and children's health than weed killing chemicals, and leasing the goats for this purpose costs less than half of what it would normally cost to clear the area.</p>\n<p>"It's a natural approach to dealing with this without using any kind of harsh chemicals of any kind. This is the more natural approach to taking care of this overgrown vegetation," said Ricardo Zubiate, Assistant Director of Facility Services for the district. "This job cost is about $3,000 compared to $8,000 or higher for other removal methods."</p>\n<p>This is the third year the district has used the goats to clear the hillside behind Washington. An electric fence keeps the goats corralled and eating in the right areas. Zubiate says there is one goat in particular that is known as an escape artist, but there have been no problems because a goat herder from 4 Leaf Ranch stays with the goats the entire time. </p>\n<p> </p>\n	<p>A group of 50 goats is tackling a problem at Washington Elementary School in a more natural manner.

The goal of the FFVP is to improve children’s overall diet and create healthier eating habits to impact their present and future health.</p>\n<p>“This program is more than just eating fresh fruit and vegetables,” said Kelly Orton, Child Nutrition Director. “In an urban environment like Salt Lake City the program also introduces children to fruits and vegetables they may not be familiar with. It expands their knowledge and can be a learning experience as well.”</p>\n<p>Elementary schools participating in the program receive $42 per student for the school year.

Educator Becky Stewart led students through speaking drills, sparring activities, and topical research to prepare students for competition. The 26 students rose to the challenge and spent several weeks preparing their affirmative and negative cases for the resolution, “In the United Students, mandatory service ought to be compulsory.” This was the first-time students had been exposed to Lincoln-Douglas debate.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to students Maximo Alcantar, Isbella Brown, Katherin Galeas, and Pierce Serrato who participated in the Utah State Middle School Debate Tournament in April at Alta High School in Sandy. More than 250 middle school students participated in the tournament. Although these four students did not place, each one expressed how much they learned and grew from this experience. In fact, these students are now interested in taking debate in high school!</p>\n<p>Annually, the tournament awards the Harry B. Davis Spirit of Utah Debate Award which honors long-time coach and community member Harry Davis who passed away in 2013. This award recognizes students whose attitude transcends trophies and accolades; a student who characterizes the very traits of humility, integrity, leadership, respect, and service that Harry Davis embodied as a friend of Utah Debate. Northwest student Katherin Galeas is the 2017 recipient of this prestigious award! Debate Coach Becky Stewart describes Katherin as “a resilient young woman with a caring heart and a vivacious personality.” Stewart goes on to explain, “Katherin has demonstrated her belief in education and the importance of work ethic. Katherin has risen to the challenge of debate class and has willingly tried everything asked of her with a can-do spirit. Katherin’s upbeat attitude lifts those around her.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to Katherin and to each one of these young, brave debators!</p>\n<p><em>Author: Rebecca Stewart, Northwest Middle School</em></p>\n	<p>For the first time, Northwest Middle School offered students a chance to hone their argument skills in a debate class during second semester.

Orton is an inspiring educator who works tirelessly to ensure her students are held to the highest standards and are fully integrated into Northwest Middle School’s culture and included in activities. Instead of being a separate part of Northwest’s learning community, Orton forges a bond between her students and the rest of the student body resulting in new friendships as well as the establishment of student allies. </p>\n<p>This outstanding teacher holds her students to high standards, and they respond positively to her expectations.  When asked what they like most about school, her students’ comments range from “Reading!” to “how numbers work in math class”.  Students study insects up close and recently learned about snakes. It is obvious that Orton instills a love for learning in her students.  Unlike most students this age, her students love school because it is a place of learning—school isn’t just about socializing and friends.</p>\n<p>Orton’s students also take classes with their fellow schoolmates.  Some of these classes are AVID (Achievement Via Individual Determination), music, physical education, dance, art, ceramics, and “Techniques for Tough Times.” Some of her students serve as library and office aides.  Two of her students have been chosen for dance teacher Natosha Washington’s prestigious Dance Company. Orton has also established a peer tutoring program where general education students serve as tutors for her students inside the classroom.</p>\n<p>Community service is part of Orton’s curriculum.  For example, her students support the school’s recycling program by collecting the recycling from each classroom on a weekly basis.  These same students operate the school store where they reward students who have been recognized by teachers for being positive role models. Her students comment that they like serving their school—it makes them happy!  Orton has seen an increase in her students’ confidence levels due to these experiences.</p>\n<p>In addition to Orton’s teaching responsibilities, she leads Northwest’s positive behavior intervention committee. In this role, she works with staff and students to develop plans for teaching and reinforcing school-wide behavior expectations.  Orton listens to the concerns of all stakeholders and implements solutions allowing for the success of all students.</p>\n<p>Under Orton’s caring leadership, her students develop a love for learning, experience increased confidence, and improve their social skills. More than one of her students thinks of Orton as a “second mom”! Orton sincerely loves her students who she says “work hard, love to learn, and show kindness to everyone.”  Orton develops independence and work ethic in her students.  Her students are at various academic levels. She encourages them not to give up when learning is difficult.  This positive outlook has been contagious!  Now the students spontaneously encourage each other with words like “Believe in yourself!” and “You can do it!”  They treat other with patience and respect. Orton believes her students are great role models for the other students in the school.</p>\n<p>Orton stays in contact with many of her past students and their families. Some former students are attending community college while others work more than one job.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the service and tutoring programs Orton has implemented promote esprit de corps school wide.  The entire school community—as well as the entire Salt Lake valley—has benefited from Orton’s leadership and passion for educating all students. </p>\n<p>Orton clearly deserves recognition for her dedication and commitment to the welfare of all students.</p>\n	<p>Lorrie Orton, teacher of Functional Academics at Northwest Middle School, is Salt Lake School District’s Special Education Teacher of the Year for 2017.

Approximately 250 students participated. It was an extravaganza of multi-cultural dance genres such as Latin, African, Polynesian, Bollywood, hip hop, swing, and modern. The auditorium was packed with family and friends.</p>\n<p>Dance teacher Natosha Washington has facilitated Northwest’s Celebration of Dance for the last five years. Washington’s passion for dance has had an energizing impact on Northwest Middle School students. Many of the dances were choreographed by the students themselves. To prepare for the performance, student dancers must commit to practicing two hours daily for close to three weeks.</p>\n<p>Washington discovered her love of dance when she sustained an injury during college and could no longer participate in sports. Washington changed her major and dance became her focus. Although Washington has performed many times, she loves choreography and teaching dance the most. She was co-director of a local dance company called RawMoves for twelve years and most recently has begun her own dance company called The Penguin Lady.</p>\n<p>Washington’s desire is for the students to leave the Celebration of Dance experience with increased confidence, newly developed friendships, improved communication skills, and acknowledged self-acceptance. Students feel proud of the work they’ve done and are eager to perform.

Students wrapped this year up with the Hogle Zoo, The Leonardo, singing, and science.</p>\n<p>Indian Hills Third Graders enjoyed sending this school off through music. <strong><em> for the Stars</em></strong> was the theme for this year’s school program. Students found heroes in their lives and historical heroes to celebrate perseverance, strength, and never giving up. Celebrating these character traits inspired our students to work hard and accomplish their dreams. These lucky students were also able to enjoy a day at the Hogle Zoo, to end their school year. After visiting the new baby zebra, seeing the lions and seals, they got to picnic at a local park and just relax. What a great way to end the year!</p>\n<p>Fourth Graders celebrated the end of the year by visiting The Leonardo and participating in mind engaging STEM activities. Each group of students were given an engineering challenge that was tested at the end of the class. Some groups were successful and others learned what they could do better next time, through trial and error. They were also able to explore the art of Flight and to engage in hand-on activities to explore even deeper. <strong><em> Celebrate </em></strong>was this year’s Fourth Grade program theme. Students sang songs that took the audience through the Fourth Grade year. All the way from “Great Balls of Fire” for PE to “For Good” to thank their teachers for a wonderful year. Ending the great year on a truly amazing note.</p>\n<p>As a whole school, Indian Hills students were able to partake in a Mad Science assembly. Students watched as this “Mad Scientist” made things explode and catch on fire through the use of Science. Some students were lucky enough to get to be his assistant.</p>\n<p>The final day of school was celebrated as a community of students. The annual School Carnival took place on the back third level on Indian Hills.

Fifth-grade teacher Adrienne Warren guided this process, but she stated that they took ownership of the projects and made a difference in their global community. </p>\n<p>Melody and Cheyenne, two fifth-grade students, described what they accomplished with UNICEF KidPower. They said, “By getting active, we can save lives by using our KidPower bands. A UNICEF KidPower band is like a Fit-Bit, but for each step, we get one point. Every day our count starts over. (0 steps, 0 points) After getting 10 points, it unlocks an RUTF packet to send to malnourished children. The RUTF (Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food) is a paste made of peanuts, nutrients, and vitamins. With the RUTF, malnourished kids can grow big and strong…just ‘cause we help out and get active every day. It’s amazing! We move around and save lives!” </p>\n<p>HeroRats was described by Caleb and Johan. They stated, “HeroRats isn’t the best name, we know. However, it’s for a really good reason. We’ve been “adopting” two HeroRats for a few weeks; their names are: Ikemba and Chewa. They’re 3ft long rats, pretty cool huh? They help the people of Eastern African countries. The rats help by sensing the presence of a landmine, so their trainer can dispose of the mine. The rats we sponsor help the African countries by disposing of landmines placed in awful civil wars.” </p>\n<p>Emma and Marlena described the SoleHope project in which they were engaged. “Another project we have is donating old jeans to SoleHope. Sole Hope is an organization that makes shoes out of denim for kids in Uganda. They make these shoes because the kids are getting jiggers (parasites) in their feet. The jiggers have to be surgically removed, but all they have to do that with is a safety pin or sharp stick. These pins can transfer the HIV Aids virus and cause the kids’ feet to bleed and get infected. So, these shoes are making it so kids don’t get jiggers.”</p>\n<p><em>Author: Barbara Stevens, Newman Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>As part of global citizenship study, some of Newman Elementary’s fifth-grade students have been involved in several projects that have benefited kids around the world: UNICEF KidPower, HeroRats, and SoleHope.

Students elected a mayor who was responsible for all of the workings of the city for the day.  The CEO of each business gave a speech to the city outlining the goals and objectives of their businesses.  At the end of the experience, one student reflected, “I didn’t know working all day was so tiring.”  </p>\n<p><em>Author: Marilyn Taft, Hawthorne Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>This was the third consecutive year Hawthorne fifth and sixth-grade students participated in JA Biztown.  After several weeks of planning and organizing, the students were responsible for all of the activities in JA City for a day.  </p>	f	2017-06-28 09:50:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:35:43.804366-06	2017-09-19 13:09:13.828232-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

SLCSE students who have enrolled in a mentoring class have been coming every Friday since the beginning of the school year, working with the students in groups and individually to help meet their academic needs. The students are engaged, happy and learning! In fact, one second grade teacher mentioned that there is a student who may have needed further assistance, but because of the work of these mentors, that student has been able to reach grade level in reading. </p>\n<p>Newman Elementary has students from diverse backgrounds with many of the students speaking at least two languages at home. This mentoring program benefits Newman students who need extra support in reading on grade level in English, while also maintaining a second or third language. </p>\n<p>The best part of the program, however, can be seen on all the student’s faces. Having 7th, 8th and 9th grade friends (mentors) who have high expectations for the second grade students to progress academically is better than recess! And based upon SLCSE student expressions, they enjoy this mentoring program just as much!</p>\n<p><em>Author: Barbara Stevens, Newman Elementary School </em></p>\n	<p>Newman’s second graders can hardly contain their excitement when they see their mentors arrive from the Salt Lake Center for Science Education (SLCSE).

By doing so, learning can take place on many different levels.</p>\n<p>“When you’re playing the character that caused a lot stuff to happen, it helped us learn it a lot,” said fifth-grade student Octavia Patno, who played King George in the production. Another student, Lauren Lords, added that by learning history and then performing, it felt a little like they were living history. Morgan Chatterton added that she had fun performing about the Boston Tea Party. She said she liked her role, she thought the play was funny, and it made it more fun to perform.</p>\n<p>Beacon Heights partners with University of Utah, Children’s Youth Theater. Grades four through six participate each year with theater teachers who team with the classroom teacher.

683	951563ae-9cae-4286-aa0c-600a3cfa20be	Guest Author: John Arthur, Teacher at Meadowlark Elementary	<p><em>...And because Icarus did not listen to his father’s warnings and flew too close to the sun, his waxen wings melted. Daedalus, horrified, could only watch as his son fell from the heavens and drowned in the sea.</em></p>\n<p>I wept real tears the first time I heard that story in school. My head was pressed into my desk, Capri Sun crumpled on the floor. I was SOOOOO MAD at Icarus! All he had to do was <u>exactly</u> what his father said and everything would have been fine. Instead, Icarus disobeyed Daedalus, died, and broke his poor father's heart.</p>\n<p>It wasn't until I read this myth to a class of my own that I realized what was really going on. As my students and I discussed the author's purpose, it occurred to me that thousands of years ago in ancient Greece, some guy in some town stood in front of some sort of crowd and told this tale for the very first time. Isn't that crazy? The fall of Icarus is one of Western Civilization's guiding metaphors and it all started with one guy, probably penniless and fallen on hard times, writing a bummer ending that, unbeknownst to him, would go on to help define intergenerational relations throughout the ages! Icarus didn't have to <em>die</em> – he fell from the sky because <em>one sad man</em> decided he should. That bitter, curmudgeonly storyteller was a <em>total</em> Daedalus, and his purpose was simple: to repress the Icarus in all of us. Fast-forward several millennia and you find out it worked, that even in the modern, hi-tech schoolhouse Icarus and those just like him still get a bad rap; case in point, kids today are still often referred to as “high-fliers” when they just can't seem to do as they're told. When are we going to realize that the problem has never been the kid flying toward the sun, but rather those shoddy wings they’ve been given that can't take the heat?</p>\n<p>The time has come to celebrate each and every Icarus in our schools, adults and kids alike! We need to make them feel welcome in the schoolhouse, honor their audacity, and elevate their spectacular failures as the high watermarks of achievement. We also need to proudly recognize that by choosing a life in education we've proven there's at least a little Icarus in <u>every</u> <u>one</u> <u>of</u> <u>us</u>! And thank goodness for that, because our students have never needed us more than they do right now. Things are tough in our schools because things are tough everywhere; hate-spewing monsters have come out of the shadows, <em>literal</em> trolls attack our kids online and on TV, and icy cold figures frighten our children, threatening to tear their families apart. Our students are smart enough to know that everything that’s come before has brought us to now, and they're waiting to see what we come up with next. I say we get out of the way and unleash the kids who can't sit still, champion the children who can’t help but <strong>shout out loud</strong>, sing praises to the students jumping fully-stretched toward the top of the doorframe, point them toward a problem and watch as they weather it down with their daring until there’s nothing left to see.</p>\n<p>I've heard it said that we become the stories we tell ourselves; if that is true, then perhaps all we need now is a new ending for an old story.</p>\n<p><em>A strong swimmer since birth, Icarus easily made his way to the shore. Daedalus ran to his son and screamed, “Why didn't you follow my instructions?”</em></p>\n<p><em>Icarus laughed. “If you didn't want me to fly, you shouldn't have given me wings!”</em></p>\n<p><em>Looking back at the salty sea, Icarus immediately recognized the flaws in his father's design – the wings were functional, and yet solely intended for escape, not </em><strong><u>flight</u></strong><em>. Icarus, driven by the desire to SOAR once more above the clouds, built a new set of wings that could withstand the heat at the highest altitudes. Not only did Icarus go on to fly higher than Hermes himself, but his innovations filled the skies with mortals who thought as he did – that we are remarkable creatures meant to do remarkable things and one day destined to redefine that which we believe to be best in ourselves.</em></p>\n	<p><em>...And because Icarus did not listen to his father’s warnings and flew too close to the sun, his waxen wings melted. Daedalus, horrified, could only watch as his son fell from the heavens and drowned in the sea.</em></p>	f	2017-05-12 10:13:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:40:26.314683-06	2017-09-19 13:09:27.118835-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Even Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, Jyn Erso, Rey and a Commander participated at Dilworth Elementary along with hundreds of friends, neighbors, students and faculty. So much to see and do…art displays, food, music, crafts, cupcakes, tomato plants and flowers, make and take crafts, something for everyone. Smiles and excitement filled the halls, classrooms, auditorium and outside grounds of Dilworth. Thanks to the BTSALP (Beverley Taylor Sorensen Arts Learning Program) grant that provides an art specialist in the school to collaborate with teachers, integrate and reinforce classroom curriculum our Dilworth Art Program continues to be an integral part of our school’s curriculum. The yearly Art Night supplements the BTSALP grant; and thanks to parents, our Dilworth community, teachers and staff, the arts continue to thrive at Dilworth.</p>\n<p>Fabulous art created by all the students filled the halls of Dilworth. Colorful animals and insects created by kindergarten through fifth-grade students were displayed on the bulletin board in the main hall. Thanks to Julie Davidson, Heather Erickson and Laurel Finlayson, our fabulous art teachers, Dilworth students’ self-portraits were displayed in the halls. In addition, our library technology teacher, Mrs. Lewis, worked with the sixth-graders students developing QR Codes so that parents could view their student's Adobe Voice about the clay birdhouses they made in art this year. The sixth-grade students also had photographs of their paintings of Trolley Square. Their original paintings are on permanent display at the Trolley Square Museum inside Trolley Square.</p>\n<p>Inside the auditorium, you could purchase a variety of crafts and decorated cupcakes that were as delicious as they were beautiful. There was even a silent auction and a photo both where you could have your picture taken with Darth Vader and his friends.</p>\n<p>Outside the lines were long but it was well worth the wait. Delicious barbequed brats, pizza and Caesar salad were available for purchase. You could also purchase tomato plants and flowers to plant in your garden. With Sharon Jorgensen at the piano, second and third-grade students performed some of their favorite songs. Large crowds gathered to catch a glimpse of these talented children. There were also some great impromptu musical performances by students of all ages.</p>\n<p>Parent volunteers worked behind the scenes to make this event possible. Teachers and staff also volunteered to help serve food, cashier, and work in various booths and oversee the make and take crafts held in classrooms. A special thank you to Amy Rigby and Alta Hales who were the chairpersons for one of our most successful Art Nights ever!!! Thank you to all the parents who collected, set up, took down, ran errands, spent hours planning and who worked tirelessly to make Dilworth Art Night an event not to be missed. Most of all, thank you to Cody and Ricky who never complained about moving tables here, there, and everywhere in order to make Art Night flow smoothly. We are especially grateful to our fabulous PTA who make events like Art Night possible and successful.

Over 300 students participated in 10 different hands-on STEM activities. The event was a huge success and is a tribute to what is possible when different committees within the school work together to improve educational opportunities for all students.</p>\n<p>Dilworth Science Family Fun Night was initiated by the School Community Council (SCC) Committee as part of the School Improvement Plan (SIP). The activity and events were organized by a committee of parents. Included in the evening’s activities was a fundraiser dinner hosted and served by the Parent Teacher Association (PTA).  In addition, the activities were run by supportive parents and teachers. The result was a science activity that will not soon be forgotten by students.</p>\n<p>Through the efforts of many, students were able to experience a myriad of science activities that covered a broad range of potential interests. Children could be found launching rockets, making slime, holding a snake, experiencing electricity, knocking down cups with air cannons, meeting a hawk and owl, learning about fossils, creating structures to withstand an earthquake shake, or using a green screen to be in a movie.

It makes a perfect place for collective art making involving large groups of students as makers and audience. Collective art is art making that is created using large groups of people negotiating working together to tell a visual story. Here are examples of projects we have done using chalk and snow.</p>\n<p>The chalk drawing was created by three fourth-grade classes and was a collective map of their community. We brainstormed a large list of all of the things that they enjoy about their neighborhood and they brought it to life in the atrium.</p>\n<p>The snow drawings are inspired by snow drawing projects around the world. We looked at some examples and then mapped out how our footprints would draw a large design.

They were to recite their memorized passage while acting like a Greek statue of their god/goddess. The movie Night of the Museum has nothing on these 6th grade students. They used their researched knowledge of gods and goddess to educate and entertain an audience. What a great way to learn about ancient civilizations. </p>\n<p>K-6 grade students have been putting on their dancing shoes this past month to participate in dance lessons taught by professional dancers.

When the barn was finished, they enjoyed the fruits of that labor of love together through a celebration. We want to encourage our new families to enjoy the bond Beacon families have for each other, to celebrate as a family the work of all of our students, and to see where they can fit to help Beacon become stronger. A big hug and thank you to all the parents who support us through their financial donations, their time with PTA, SCC, and their most precious donation of time to help our children.</p>\n<p>Art Night is also a night where Beacon Heights earns funds from community donations to support arts programs for the coming year. However, the evening was more of a celebration than anything.</p>\n<p>“Art night is not just about raising money to pay for next year's dance and theater experiences, but a time for our community to come together as one, at a very beautiful part of our school year,” principal Rae Louie said. “We hope to celebrate together in a very family way, the hard work and learning of all of our children.”</p>\n<p>Congratulations to all Beacon Heights students who transformed the hallways of their school into a beautiful gallery of artistic work.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Amber Callister, Beacon Heights Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>Beacon Heights recently celebrated their yearly Art Night.

The idea grew out of the district Character Education committee’s focus on kindness during February. During the first week of the month, Kindness Kits were delivered to each classroom. These kits held ideas for activities, lessons, books, and videos that would help students learn about being kind to each other. Some classes watched kindness videos and discussed themes, while other classes wrote acrostic poems about kindness or wrote examples of kind language to use with others. Teachers also worked with students to identify kind acts they could do throughout the month.</p>\n<p>Throughout the school students were seen holding doors, giving compliments, and helping teachers. Some classes took on bigger projects as well. Sixth-grade students cleaned up trash outside, and third-grade students wrote thank you letters to soldiers and other community helpers. Throughout the month, students used bingo boards, posters, and tally marks to add up all the kind deeds they performed. All that effort added up: the final total of kind acts topped 1,000 in just one month.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Jeanne Winters Morriss, Backman Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>Backman students were racking up kind acts in the month of February during a school-wide focus on Random Acts of Kindness.

In Salt Lake City School District, approximately <strong>56%</strong> of our students qualify for free or reduced-price meals, so it is important to us that the information being shared in our community is clear and accurate.</p>\n<ul><li>Parents are encouraged to submit one application for free and reduced meal benefits for the entire household during the annual online student registration process in August, prior to the first day of school. However, if financial situations change, an application can be submitted any time during the school year.</li>\n<li>You can find the application online at <a href="http://www.slcschools.org/departments/child-nutrition/Free-and-Reduced-Meal-Application.php">http://www.slcschools.org/departments/child-nutrition/Free-and-Reduced-Meal-Application.php</a>, or you can contact the Child Nutrition Department at (801) 974-8380.</li>\n</ul><p>For families who do not qualify for free or reduced meals, access to nutritious meals is also important. Regardless of the ability to pay, students will not be denied school meals.</p>\n<ul><li>Our Child Nutrition policy specifically states, “The child nutrition program will not discriminate against, nor physically segregate, any student because of his or her inability to pay the full price of a meal or milk. Schools must ensure that students eligible to receive free or reduced price meals, or whose meal accounts have a low balance or are delinquent, are not easily identifiable or subject to ridicule, or embarrassment.”</li>\n<li>If a student’s meal account is inadequate to pay for a meal, the school will provide a full meal to the student, and parents will be notified by the school.</li>\n</ul>	<p>Recent news coverage of school lunch issues may have caused some confusion among our parents about our school lunch and breakfast programs, especially the issue of qualifying for free and reduced lunch.</p>	f	2017-05-17 17:06:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:40:25.11087-06	2017-09-19 13:09:25.166453-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Today, school libraries are places for students to gather not only to conduct research, to study, and to work on group projects but also to socialize.  Dallin Miller, Northwest Middle School’s Library Technology Specialist, is transforming the school’s library into the school center for learning as well as for meeting up with friends.</p>\n<p>Miller revamped the physical space of the library by replacing the outdated heavy wood tables and chairs with modern round tables and easy to move chairs.  This new furniture makes working on group projects easier for students.  Among the book stacks, Miller placed several two-seat couches and low tables where students can put together puzzles or play a game of chess. There is comfortable seating for patrons who want to read a magazine or a book alone. Soft music plays in the background and students are no longer shushed!  Since the library’s physical transformation, Miller reports more students coming into the library throughout the day—before and after school and during lunch. Students feel welcome. Additionally, more books are being checked out and the library center is being used by more of its stakeholders than in past years. </p>\n<p>The library offers an after-school time called Brain Boost Monday through Thursday. Students can use the library to complete homework, use the computers, or hang out with friends. Today’s school library is more like a Starbucks coffee shop—but you’ll have to bring your own coffee!</p>\n<p>Besides modernizing the physical space, Miller is transforming his role as librarian in the following ways.  As the media specialist, Miller actively participates as part of the school’s learning community by sharing responsibility for student learning.  He offers his services as collaborator and co-teacher for lessons requiring research and inquiry. Miller ensures that students and staff are effective users of ideas and information. He teaches students how to access library resources from home and helps parents access PowerSchool so they can check their student’s grades.  Miller informs and trains teachers on new tech tools that engage and support student learning.  He troubleshoots basic technology issues for teachers in their classrooms.  Miller actively participates as a team member in the school’s decision-making process. Miller hosted a very successful book fair last year that netted $2700 and plans to host another one in January.</p>\n<p>Miller publishes a monthly newsletter that informs the school’s community about which novels are trending among students and about new and exciting tech tools that increase learning.  He also writes a blog and manages a library website that provides links to information for students and teachers.</p>\n<p>This year is Miller’s second as Library Media Specialist. He is continuing to look for ways to effectively use the library’s space as a learning center.  For example, Miller hopes to incorporate makerspaces.  Makerspaces are areas where students can make short movies, create art projects, or work on science fair projects.  Miller also plans to offer a flight simulation class after school for small student teams to learn about aeronautics.  He continually reaches out to teachers offering his support for technology integration or to help plan and teach an inquiry project. </p>\n<p>One of Miller’s favorite quotes is, “What’s the point of being alive if you don’t try something remarkable!”.  Come into Northwest Middle School’s Library Learning Center today and see some remarkable learning happen . . . it may even be your own!</p>\n	<p>School libraries—and the role of librarian—have changed!  Due to the digitization of content and wide internet accessibility, school libraries no longer function as a repository of printed materials accessible only in one physical location whose singular role is book checkout.</p>	f	2016-12-07 15:11:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:57.846186-06	2017-09-19 13:10:21.258876-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

This is the second such event the school and its community partners have sponsored this year. On an overcast Saturday morning this fall, more than 80 members of the Backman community gathered in this same space to clean, clear branches and repair the trail that runs along the river. This project, overseen by Backman’s family and school collaboration specialist Karina Lugo Villalba, was one step in a plan to create a safe and clean space for students as they travel to school from River Cove apartments and other complexes on the other side of the river from Backman Elementary. Additional steps include petitioning the city for an area that will include a bridge that spans the river and green space nearby that could be used for an outdoor classroom.</p>\n<p>The morning of the Jordan River clean up, community organizations gathered early to get project areas set up. REI’s outreach program greeted families, students, staff and neighbors with t-shirts and an encouraging smile, while workers with the Utah Conservation Crew helped unload mulch along the trail. Volunteers used rakes and shovels to create a smoother path for running and walking along the river. Families of Backman students worked side-by-side with teachers and other staff members to clear the current path used by students traveling to school. Students of all ages, including former Backman students who are now in middle school, came to pick up trash. The collective effort made a big difference for students. David, a 4<sup>th</sup> grader at Backman who participated in the event with his mom, said, “Now when I go to school and pass by the river, it reminds me of the hard work people did for us.”</p>\n<p>The Earth Day event will include some of the same clean-up activities but also opportunities to explore science themes, such as plant growth by planting wildflower seeds. All members of the Salt Lake community are invited to help. As David, the 4<sup>th</sup> grader, pointed out after the fall event, “I wanted to help because it’s MY community and we should take care of our community.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Jeanne Winters Morriss, Backman Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>The Backman community will sponsor an Earth Day event April 22 to both continue the clean up of the Jordan River area that borders the school and celebrate science.

It provides a cost-effective food distribution point for children and their families at the end of the school day in a safe and trusted environment—the school playground.</p>\n<p>Each month during the school year, their truck arrives at Bennion Elementary where Utah Food Bank staff and volunteers assist students and their parents as they sign in and receive food. The amount of food distributed varies depending on availability of donated and purchased foods. Every attempt is made to provide as many healthy items as possible.</p>\n<p>Mobile School Pantry deliveries are only available to the students of that school and their families and are completely free to the schools and their families in need. <strong>The growth and impact of this program has been astounding—last year, through distribution at 36 school sites, Utah Food Bank reached 156,696 individuals, 85,776 of whom were children.</strong> This year, they are serving over 50 sites!</p>\n<p>The Mobile School Pantry program approaches childhood hunger with the understanding that children are only truly protected from the pain and anxiety of hunger when their whole family has enough food to stay healthy. This approach makes the Mobile School Pantry program especially effective. Teachers and school administrators report that this holistic approach creates better educational environments and a stronger sense of community among the student body and their families.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Avan Thayn, Bennion Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>Utah Food Bank’s newest program, Mobile School Pantry, complements both school meal programs and other childhood hunger programs.

They shared first place in a field of 38 teams which competed at Boise State University ranging from Idaho, California, Utah, Washington and Canada.</p>\n<p>Each year, the West High robotics team participates in a new competition played on a basketball sized field, which is announced in January. They then have six intense weeks to build and design their robot, which are typically about four feet tall and weigh approximately 100 pounds. The team meets every day after school and on weekends to build, design and practice with their robot. This year, the team had to construct a robot to climb a rope to board an airship, as well as place gears on an airship and score fuel elements (whiffle balls) into a boiler. The team separates into sub teams to accomplish all the tasks. These included marketing, outreach, safety, drive, software, hardware, electrical, and frame/bumper design teams.</p>\n<p>The team was awarded an Industrial Design award for its work at the Idaho Regional. Team Captain Sebastion Jenson designed (in CAD-like software) a claw to catch the rope the robot climbed. The claw was then 3D printed on new printers made available to West High’s CTE department from a generous grant from Tesoro. The claw was then modified three to four times in design, and reprinted until a more optimal design was finalized.</p>\n<p>The software team, led by Ross Kilpatrick, programmed a vision tracking algorithm for the first 30 second autonomous period. The robot used a usb-webcam to recognize reflective tape and used the tracking algorithm to position the robot so that it could deliver a gear to repair the airship. The software team also worked closely with the electrical team to run motors so that the robot could drive and enable its climbing mechanism. The electrical team, led by Ben Kieda and Avery Shumway designed a novel approach to organize all the wires from the motor controllers this year. They ran the wires all together in a custom made board that’s durability and reliability proved important in the playoff rounds when robots take major impacts and damage.</p>\n<p>The team’s history and accomplishments are chronicled at <a href="http://team3006.com/">http://team3006.com</a>. Each year, entry fees alone are $5,000. The team is currently sponsored by: Tesoro, West High School, the Salt Lake Education Foundation, Biofire, University of Utah Physics, TSLOT, Trilium Mortgage, Sugarhouse Veterinary Hospital, and Alsco.</p>\n<p><strong>About FIRST Robotics Competition</strong><br />\nFIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) was founded in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology.

Over the next hour, students learned tidbits of history and social etiquette. They learned country line dances as well as other modern square dances.</p>\n<p>Although hesitant at first, the students warmed up quickly by doing the Hokey Pokey and other basic dances that got students moving. After warming up, students sashayed, jumped, heel toed, and circled around their partners throughout the gymnasium. By the end of the assembly, all students appeared comfortable and were having a good time.</p>\n<p>Jameson Pace, a third grader said at the beginning he was “horrified.” He said the thought of dancing with a girl made him not want to go to the assembly. By the time the assembly was over, Jameson’s friend, Colin Hales, added “Jameson said when it was over, it wasn’t so bad. He said it was kinda fun.”</p>\n<p>Ashwin Gurusankar, a second grader agreed saying, “I thought I would die,” he added, “since [dancing with a girl] is not really what I like doing.”</p>\n<p>By the time the assembly was over, Ashwin said, “I guess it wasn’t so bad.” He added that his partner could dance the way he liked.</p>\n<p>Principal Rae Louie added, “Nothing makes my heart happier than to see kids enjoying dance!

One of Ms. Briggs-Cook’s ELL learners started the year as a non-reader and is now reading ninety-two words per minute. Mr. Mike has contributed greatly to this reading growth.  Second grade teacher and parent, Ms. Stone, writes, “As a parent I find Mike to be so kind and supportive.  He always tells me how wonderful my son is and how much he enjoys working with him.  He shares with me the growth he sees in my son and simply ends with a sweet comment about how special he is.” </p>\n<p>In addition to his tutoring responsibilities, Mr. Mike spends an hour each day helping in Mrs. Briggs-Cook’s first grade classroom.  He reads aloud to children, works with students on math, offers assistance with difficult children, and runs copies for frantic teachers.  Ms.  Briggs-Cook added, that “Mr. Mike’s attitude and positive outlook is contagious and impacts the classroom climate.”</p>\n<p>In addition to Mike’s time in first grade, he also volunteers in the full day kindergarten classrooms.  Mike helps manage daily center activities. He guides students to work stations and assists with academic projects.  Ms. Goleniewski mentioned, “Mike is very friendly to all and helpful during kindergarten center time.”  Mike also spends a half hour each day reading with struggling students.  Mrs. Ensign enthusiastically expressed, “Mike is always so optimistic and encouraging with all the students, especially those who need extra attention.”</p>\n<p>Mike’s optimistic outlook carries through the halls of Uintah. When he is not volunteering in the lower grade classrooms, he is finding other ways to support our school community. Principal O’Brien noticed that it’s the little things that Mike does that impact all of us, like the time he brought me lunch on a particularly hard day.  Elizabeth Burt, a third grade teacher, professed, “Mike always finds a way to encourage and uplift others, whether it’s leaving a compliment for me to tell my students or wishing me a peaceful day.  He somehow manages to find the upside to every situation.  It’s hard not to feel a little lighter after talking to Mike.  Mike has had challenges that have given him every opportunity for negativity but he shines as an example of how to look beyond one’s self and never give up.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Mike McFarland’s life has been built around caring for others.  His immeasurable generosity makes him a shining example of the true volunteer spirit. </p>\n<p><em>Author: Kody Colvin, Uintah Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>Mike’s volunteer career began twenty years ago at Indian Hills Elementary where he worked in a special education classroom and the library.  Fortunately for Uintah Elementary, Mr. Mike joined our school community.  He has been working at Uintah for five years, and has helped us in many different ways.</p>\n	f	2017-03-31 09:29:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:40:34.361121-06	2017-09-19 13:09:40.735817-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Some of these characters included Benjamin Franklin, Sacajawea, Elizabeth Candy Stanton, Sitting Bull, and Thomas Paine. </p>\n<p>The performance was a culmination of a year-long collaboration between the fifth-grade teachers; the librarian, who did biographical research with each student; the art teacher, who taught students portrait drawings; and the music teacher, who taught several historical songs for the performance. Over 50 students tried out for solo parts in the musical. Each student who wanted a speaking and/or musical part was able to perform. </p>\n<p>Following the musical, the grade opened up a wax museum where each student came to life as an individual historical character. They told of the impact these people had on our country. </p>\n<p>According to Mrs. Paula Marquez, one of the fifth-grade teachers, "There is no better way to teach the impact of what our founding fathers and mothers did for us as American citizens than learning through music, art, and personal research.  These kids learned a ton from this experience."</p>\n<p><em>Author: Staci Rodriguez, Highland Park Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>The fifth grade at Highland Park spent Friday, March 24, back in time in U.S. History as they performed their musical and wax museum "We Celebrate America." Students spent the majority of the year researching an important person who greatly influenced the history of America.</p>	f	2017-03-28 11:01:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:40:34.897516-06	2017-09-19 13:09:41.722016-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

749	4255fa03-7be1-448f-99dc-0831bd4bb4d9	Guest Author: Jane Berntson, Principal at Hillside Middle School 	<p><strong>“Education Forms the Mind but the Soul Makes the Man.”</strong></p>\n<p>This quote from my great, great grandfather was hung and said in our home while we were growing up and now hangs in my office at Hillside Middle School.  There are many reasons and pathways which have lead me to becoming an educator and many examples of the kind of educator I want to be.  The examples that follow were helpful in my decision to become an educator.</p>\n<p>I had a great aunt who was an elementary school teacher back in the early 1900’s.  She was very strict and systematic in her teaching but shared with me as a little girl the importance of learning and encouraged me to read and explore everything.  In fact, she had a small desk for me to sit at to draw or read or look through the World Book Encyclopedia when we came to visit her.  (I think she knew I wouldn’t sit still and quiet while the big people visited.) From this small practice, I always had a desk in my room to do homework or read. Today, I still make sure I have a quiet place to work or read. What a great impression to leave with a young person.</p>\n<p>My mom chose education as a career when she was in her 50’s and attended the University of Utah to finish her degree and receive her license to teach with my friends from high school who were in the same program. She had to change her direction of life at the time to accomplish the goal she had set to obtain when she was much younger. This was not an easy decision for someone who would be competing for jobs against a much younger career oriented pool of candidates. She prevailed and taught at the elementary level for many years and enjoyed every day with her students and seeing them grow and learn. My brothers and I enjoyed hearing her students’ successes and fun stories from her classroom.  From her example, I learned dedication and true grit.</p>\n<p>Mr. Johnson was my English teacher at West High School.  He encouraged his students to be brave and take on new challenges in our education.  One of those challenges was public speaking.  Part of our assignment was to write a short speech regarding something we felt confident about and share that with the class.  Of course, at 16, I did not feel too confident about anything, so, I chose to speak about putting on mascara.  Yes, it was the highlight of my speaking career!  I spoke about the application and choosing the right brand and color for the look you wanted.  My classmates chuckled because they had prepared some very impressive topics to speak on.  Mr. Johnson complimented me on my courage to think outside of the box and speak on something no one had done before.  Because of that experience, I have been better prepared to speak publicly (mainly in front of students at assemblies) and I feel confident when I am asked to speak.</p>\n<p>During my student teaching many years ago at Northwest Middle School Rosemary Baron was the administrator of the school.  Then years later she was appointed principal of Clayton Middle School where I was teaching.  Mrs. Baron was a remarkable school leader who set the bar high for student learning.  On her office door was a sign, “Head Learner” of the school.  She expected students to work hard, to be kind and generous and above all everyone needed to do their part in making the school a great place to be.  Mrs. Baron encouraged me to pursue a Master Degree in Education/School Leadership and to become a school principal.  I followed her lead and every day work hard to be a great school leader as she was.</p>\n<p>Education is something I truly love and am very happy doing.  I have been influenced by many great educators who inspired me to be dedicated, resilient, a person of good character, and courageous in my learning.  They instilled in me the importance of education and the benefits that can come when we put forth our best effort. It is my goal to inspire and encourage students and teachers to set and reach their goals and to become a person of character that others will look up to. </p>\n	<p>“Education Forms the Mind but the Soul Makes the Man.”</p>\n<p>This quote from my great, great grandfather was hung and said in our home while we were growing up and now hangs in my office at Hillside Middle School.</p>\n	f	2017-03-13 12:30:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:40:38.662629-06	2017-09-19 13:09:47.024865-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Art night 2017 continued the tradition of celebrating the importance of art at Emerson. The wet weather did not stop families from coming out to enjoy a night of crafts, music, food and art. The hallways were decorated with master pieces from the school year and parents could even pay to have the work framed or order custom art cards. Students with big smiles roamed the hallway with face paint provided by the PTA and sweet treats from the bake sale. The talent show brought cheers from the community as students sang and entertained in solos up to the Kindergartens coming together with fifth and sixth grade ukulele players to perform ‘I Like to Teach the World to Sing’. Ms. Theresa Musick led the third graders in some cool and happy music. Mr. Josh Craner and his sixth graders were behind the scenes supporting and lending a hand. When the Emerson faculty comes together for arts, it is magic!</p>\n<p>Ms. Laura Anderson’s class kept the creativity going the following week and put on a new tradition at Emerson, the sixth grade dinner theater. Her class worked hard learning lines, dance moves, the history of jazz as well as creating props to perform Shorty George’s Jitterbug Jam. The audience was treated to performers like Ela Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. The crowd cheered at the sensational moves of Michael Jackson and Elvis. The students did a fabulous job and had fun sharing the knowledge of jazz.</p>\n<p><em>Author: Shelly Powell Hamilton, Emerson Elementary</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n	<p>Emerson has had two full weeks of art.

716	453488f9-053b-4604-a602-80aa67730aa7	Guest Author: Marilyn Taft, Teacher at Hawthorne Elementary	<p>I cannot pinpoint a moment in time when I made a decision to be a teacher. Events unfolded serendipitously and powerfully until I reached the conclusion, “It is never too late to be what you might have been.” This quote, erroneously attributed to George Eliot, is nevertheless true for me. What I might have been was a teacher; through hard work and determination, I became one. I had an MBA and fifteen years of experience in the corporate world when I left the workforce to remain at home with my young children. As they began school, I helped in their classrooms and substituted regularly, following in the footsteps of the finest educators I have known. Their sub plans and lessons were the building blocks of my pedagogy. </p>\n<p>Young people amaze me. I teach ELP (gifted) students who are often misunderstood. They can be brash, almost to the point of rudeness. They demand to know things because things matter to them. They argue because they want to sort the world out for themselves. They give up too soon because they fear failure short of perfection. They realize all people make mistakes and point mine out on a regular basis. I am not offended; that is how they learn and I improve. My students challenge me to keep up with them and I challenge them to think more deeply. I understand their occasionally painful asynchronous development and help them find ways to soar. </p>\n<p>Michelangelo once remarked, “Yet, I am still learning.” Teachers learn every day. For those who relish learning, teaching is the best job in the world. Stimuli that enter our classrooms moment by moment are energizing and wondrous. Questions, thoughts, ideas, connections, leaps, and experiments enliven my soul. Change is everywhere and change is exciting. </p>\n<p>Every once in a while, I remember my corporate career with an expense account, secretary, elegant clothes, bonuses, travel, and a private office. Some people think teachers have an expense account, but it amounts to only small change per student each month. I could wear elegant clothes to school, but who wants paint and glue on a wool suit? Teachers and students travel….on field trips. I’ve taken clients to PGA tour events at some of the finest golf courses in the world; I wouldn’t trade those trips for sunny days my students and I traipse in the Great Salt Lake testing water samples, days we search Timpanogos Cave for helictites, or days we scamper in Little Cottonwood Canyon examining evidence of glaciers on a granite slab larger than the footprint of our school building. </p>\n<p>And so I am a teacher, exploring with my students each day, all of us attempting to become, what we may be.</p>\n	<p>I cannot pinpoint a moment in time when I made a decision to be a teacher.

Kim Lane, North Star’s extended learning program teacher and science specialist, coordinated with the University of Utah to bring this learning experience to North Star students.     </p>\n<p>Students had the opportunity to explore the neurosciences through various modules presented by University of Utah graduate students. These modules included learning everything from memory and neuron function to impaired vision and brain anatomy. One module demonstrated how neurons stimulate muscle fiber, which was observed through auditory effects; another model demonstrated how cramming information right before a test is an ineffective way to retain that information; another module showed the effects a concussion has on our vision (students wore “concussion goggles” and had to walk in a straight line). Perhaps nothing was more exciting than observing, and for those that wanted, actually holding a human brain.</p>\n<p>In addition to being exposed to a new branch of science, students were also able to interact with college students that enabled them to create new experiences that build connections to life-long learning.

Multiple studies have been done that show that music can lead to improved memory, language, reasoning, coordination, self-esteem, and student engagement, just to name of few.</p>\n<p>Edison Elementary is so fortunate to have an incredible music teacher, Mr. Asman. Edison students get a half hour of music a week, for one quarter of the school year as part of their regular school day. However, Mr. Asman also offers after school music Monday-Friday. Students are lucky enough to get to choose two days a week that they would like to participate in afterschool music at no cost to the student’s family. Students go to music from 3:00 until 3:45 on the two days they sign up for. Every 10 weeks a new round of music starts and students are able to sign up again or sign up for the first time. The students also do a music performance for family and friends at the end of each 10-week session. Mr. Asman offers fourth and fifth grade recorders, kindergarten through second grade mixed choir, third through fifth grade mixed choir, Kindergarten through second grade ensemble; and third through fifth grade ensemble.  All of the music classes teach the students the art of preforming alone and in groups, as well as social skills and confidence.</p>\n<p>All of us want our students to have a chance to interact with their peers and build up their self-esteem and Mr. Asman offers our students that opportunity.

Teens don’t automatically know how to communicate effectively when faced with a conflict or a problem.  Students who have participated commented that they have learned the importance of asking probing questions and of using “I” messages when dealing with conflict.  In the program, students learn how to facilitate mediation.  Some have described situations in which they were able to apply the techniques they learned.  One student was able to mediate a family discussion that had spiraled out of control regarding a sibling’s teen pregnancy.  Another student stopped an argument between cousins that was disrupting a family dinner. Students like that they can be honest during class and many of them like that the class “pushes them beyond their comfort zone” so “they can move ahead in life.”  Clearly, students’ lives, along with their families’ lives, are positively impacted by what they are learning.</p>\n<p>Viana recalls his own school experience as sometimes negative. “My counselor and some of my teachers quickly made up their minds about my future.  They thought that my inability to speak English restricted my academic choices.  They did not understand, however, that it was their job to teach me how to succeed academically,” shares Viana. </p>\n<p>He makes sure his students understand that failure is not permanent.  Viana emphasizes that failure only means that they are not able to do things . . .yet.   Viana believes students have the ability to grow their intelligence—and along with hard work and dedication—they will be able to achieve all of the things they deserve in life</p>\n<p>His school experience and his love for all students made Viana the perfect candidate to teach this class at Northwest.  Viana works hard to establish a safe learning community so students will open up and “be real” about their lives.  Viana often shares personal stories to help the students feel comfortable in opening up about their own experiences and lives.  He has students participate in lots of team building activities.  Viana comments that students respond positively to this class.  Students report greater confidence in dealing with problems and conflicts.  Families and students experience the benefits of the students’ increased communication skills.</p>\n<p>Northwest uses these students’ new skills to conduct mediation for their peers when resolving conflict within the school.  Viana notes that the students who conduct the mediation develop valuable social skills and increased confidence and self-esteem. Opportunities to mediate in conflicts between peers allow students to practice and master the social and emotional skills they are learning in the classroom.  </p>\n<p>The student data collected from last year shows that overall attendance, citizenship, and academic performance improved for students taking this class.  Techniques for Tough Times is a powerful force in building the social, emotional, and academic resilience teenagers need today for becoming successful members of society.</p>\n	<p>Teacher Javier Viana teaches Techniques for Tough Times at Northwest Middle School.  The curriculum was developed by Salt Lake high school teacher and researcher Leigh Vandenakker.  She designed the curriculum to help students navigate difficult life issues using positive, proactive strategies.  Northwest is one of two middle schools in the district to implement the program.  This year is the s</p>	f	2016-12-09 09:15:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:57.114087-06	2017-09-19 13:10:20.073912-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

This year proved to be the most spectacular of all.  187 students performed in <em>The Lion King Junior.</em>   Over 4,000 costume pieces were used, and student actors had more than 580 costume changes in the first act alone.  Elaborate puppets danced across the stage and throughout the auditorium; from the small sized Zazu the hornbill and the three evil hyenas, to massive elephants and giraffes on stilts.  The magic of the costumes, acting and sets created a breathtaking performance that belied the youthfulness of Hillside’s performers while telling Disney’s story about Simba the Lion, his father Mufasa, and a host of other beloved characters.</p>\n<p>In addition to sensational costuming and sets, Hillside students mastered music in five African languages. Many of the youthful lead performers appeared to have skill beyond their years. With the majority of the musical numbers beginning acapella, the maturity of the performers showed as they blended perfectly whenever the soundtrack was added.  Every performance wowed audiences and Hillside sold out every show and received many standing ovations. </p>\n<p>Hillside’s musical production was organized by the theater teacher, Nate Holcomb and a board of parents and administrators. This group’s creativity and vision to make all things possible resulted in this astoundingly popular event. Enthusiastic word of mouth about the incredible event brought in large numbers of people requesting to purchase tickets, and tickets quickly sold out.   Salt Lake District’s superintendent, Dr. Cunningham requested to come to a performance and spoke to the audience and performers to congratulate and compliment Hillside on a remarkable production.   Audience participants spoke highly about the many magical moments in “The Lion King”--every eye-catching and riveting scene; from young Simba and Nala’s adventures, to the treachery of Scar and the death of his brother Mufasa.  Large ensemble casts provided a steady stream of background, vocal music while main cast members sang lead parts to move the story effectively. Each song resonated with complex harmonization.</p>\n<p>In addition to the majesty of the play, the audience enjoyed cameos from Director Nate Holcomb, Principal Jane Berntson, and even Darth Vader who voiced, “Simba, I am your father.”  These cameos added elements of fun and surprise for the audience and for many of the performers who did not know what to expect in the cameos. </p>\n<p><em>Author: Cari Fifield, Hillside Middle School</em></p>\n	<p>Hillside Middle School has built amazing school plays over the past few years.

Our Library Aid/Playground Assistant brought her loom and woven materials to the library to showcase her beautiful samples of what a loom and crafter can create. Our third-grade students were able to try out what it would be like to weave a table runner. After each student tried their hand with the loom, they chose yarn for themselves to create a bracelet by weaving the yarn together.

The students can barely contain their excitement at seeing their Backman Buddies, students from an older grade who serve as mentors for younger students. The fifth-grade students have come today to create poetry and watercolor art work with their younger buddies. But the students know their partnership is about more than this. Fifth-grade student Stephanie said being able to have fun with the younger students is just part of her reason for being there. “They also need an example of what they should be in the future: educated, brave and giving 100 percent.”</p>\n<p>The Backman Buddies program, a new venture for the 2016-2017 school year, was conceived by a group of experienced teachers that serve as mentors for newer teachers, for just this purpose – to create more positive peer-to-peer and class-to-class connections. Teachers in older grades were asked to pair with teachers from younger grades and plan one event per trimester for buddies to do together. Classroom teachers took this idea and ran with it, getting together even more often and foster positive relationships between their students. Classes have joined up for science experiments, art projects, performances, reading time and most recently, encouragement. As state testing begins, teachers are having students write positive notes to their buddies and deliver them to give each other a boost. These notes just confirm what students participating in the program already know – their buddies have their backs.</p>\n<p>Lionel, a second-grade student, said he knows he can rely on his buddy, “If we mess up, they can help us do better.” </p>\n<p><em>Author: Jeanne Winters Morriss, Backman Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>In Hannah Wille’s classroom at Backman Elementary, second-grade students wiggle eagerly and wave from their seats as fifth-grade students from Jacki Baron’s class filter in, waving back.

Many of the students worked on their projects at school with the support of teachers and parents.</p>\n<p>It was clear our students of today are already asked to think of and explore topics that were never a thought when we were children.  From an early age our students are engulfed in handheld devices, computers that are a thousand times more powerful than even a decade ago, and digital media available at the click of a button.  This all opens a student’s world of learning to almost anything their mind can think of.  Gone are the days of Encyclopedia Britannica’s and arrives a world of unlimited resources. </p>\n<p>This was apparent as judges, parents, students and faculty walked through the science fair and witnessed the new ideas and the complexity involved with the experiments.  One was able to see displays of complicated circuits, modern takes on friction and its effects on a snowboard, hovercrafts made of balloons and CDs, even an amazing display of a home-made “pop pop” boat which used the heat of a candle to propel a boat forward in the water.  What was most impressive of it all was not only seeing the displays, but witnessing the students flourish and show a full understanding of what they were presenting.  It only reaffirmed that our students today have unlimited potential and now more than ever look forward to and need our direction and guidance as teachers. </p>\n<p>Thank you to all the teachers and volunteers who spent countless hours helping Mountain View Students create innovative projects and helping them become critical thinkers that will help them succeed in school, the workplace and in life. </p>\n<p><em>Author: Megan Hilton, Mountain View Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>For months, the students at Mountain View Elementary have been preparing for the school’s science fair.

As a class, they read fables and decided to write an opera based on a few of their favorites. The students worked together to write the lyrics based on three famous fables: the Tortoise and the Hare, the Lion and the Mouse and The Three Billy Goats Gruff. Together they wove (and sung) the main theme of having one “summon the courage to make life grand, for you and others. Have the courage to make life grand.” The name of their opera was Tales of Courage.</p>\n<p>According to Mr. Lingen, "The opera begins when we find a story to tell. I try to choose a story from different cultures or places. This year I combined three stories into one with the common theme of courage. Then we outline the songs needed to tell the story, about 21 songs. There is always an opening to preview the story and closing song to talk about what we learned. We meet as a class and go through the process of writing one song together lyrics then music, using the piano in class. Then we make small groups of students and give them a song to write with their part of the outline. They write the lyrics."</p>\n<p>After their songs were written, Mrs. Jennifer Purdy, Highland Park music teacher, stepped in and helped the students take their simple melodies and then turn them into “memorable pieces of music.” Students rehearsed daily for over three weeks and performed twice, once for the community at Hillside and another time for their student body at Highland Park.</p>\n<p>One student said, “I liked being part of [the] opera and singing.” Another said his favorite part was how the “three stories were combined.”</p>\n<p>Tales of Courage was the 11th opera that Mr. Lingen and Mrs. Purdy have written and performed.

First, the leopards kicked off the month with their traditional annual Sadie Hawkins’ dance on Saturday, February 4. It was the perfect way for East High Student Government to put together a fun event where love and friendship could bloom!</p>\n<p>Students at EHS showed the kindness in their hearts (literally!), by participating in a school-wide blood drive on Tuesday, February 7. Not only did this event allow for students to give blood that will help others in need of it, but they also received credit towards community service hours. We are so proud of all of those who donated and who volunteered to work this event!</p>\n<p>The second weekend of the month, February 10 and 11, was full of aquatic adrenaline! Our East High Swim team went to the State Championship match and the results were awesome. Their love for the sport certainly led to some victories: 11th-grader Katy Mayertook fourth place in the 50-free event and fifth in the 100-free event, 11th-grader Nate Van Buren took second place in the 100-breast event, ninth-grader Katya Hulse took fourth in both the 100-free event and the 100-backstroke event.</p>\n<p>February was also the last month for students at East to donate to their Make-A-Wish fund. The leopards adopted Alex, an 8-year-old boy suffering from Leukemia, and they worked towards raising $10,000 to send Alex and his family to Disney World and make this wish come true. This ongoing schoolwide service project has truly allowed everyone to show love towards Alex and his fight against cancer. Also, in matters of the selfless hearts, East High held their second annual East Service Day to wrap up the month. All freshmen, sophomores, and seniors were invited to participate in a day of service held at East where they could sort clothing donations, write letters to the military overseas, and/or make lunch packs to take to the youth shelter. Both of these service activities paved the way for all leopards to feel the love that comes from helping those in need.</p>\n<p>The impulse towards friendship resonated deeply at East High School during the annual Multicultural Assembly on Friday, February 17. This assembly highlights students performing traditional and culturally-rich numbers that represent the many nationalities found within the student body. The students who perform can share their passion towards their native cultures and the students in the audience have the chance to appreciate the diverse friendships they have formed throughout their years at EHS.</p>\n<p>The East High leopards couldn’t forget to show love to their Women’s Basketball team who made it all the way to the state quarter-finals game! The girls were scheduled to play against Judge Memorial High School at 2:30pm on Wednesday, February 23. Although, school was in session during that time, the awesome administration and transportation teams allowed for a “Spirit Bus” to travel with students who purchased a ticket to the game. The love and support that the spirit bus riders brought to the Salt Lake Community College gymnasium was felt throughout the entire game. Unfortunately, a buzzer shot placed the Judge bulldogs ahead and they took the victory. Nonetheless, we are all very proud to say that we love our East Women’s Basketball team!  Go Lady Leopards!</p>\n<p>The month of love couldn’t be wrapped up without a little bit of music! The talented East High Theatre club deserves 5 out of 5 stars for their first-ever production of the musical <em>Sister Act</em>. The students and their amazing director, Mr. McClellan, never seize to impress the crowd of supporters with the performances they put on for everyone to enjoy. We wish them the best of luck with their upcoming State Drama 1 acts and their well-known, annual Take Five acts. </p>\n<p><em>Author; Sandy Lopez, East High School</em></p>\n	<p>The month of February certainly set a tone of love and friendship throughout East High and the many activities that took place. First, the leopards kicked off the month with their traditional annual Sadie Hawkins’ dance on Saturday, February 4. It was the perfect way for East High Student Government to put together a fun event where love and friendship could bloom!</p>	f	2017-03-14 09:13:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:40:38.376347-06	2017-09-19 13:09:46.594009-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

During that time, I experienced teaching third graders and fifth graders.  The school I worked in became one of the first year-round institutions in the state.  During my off track time I taught writing to every grade level.  I loved teaching.</p>\n<p>One day I was invited into my principal’s office.  She and the assistant principal asked me if I had a master’s degree.  At that time, I was busy raising two children and had not considered going back to college to further my education, after all, teaching full time and a family monopolized my life. My administrators told me that they thought I would make a great principal and encouraged me to get my masters in educational administration.  Within six months I had followed through with their prompting and was accepted into a two year long cohort at the University of Utah.  Now, Jane, a close friend of mine, would tell you that I only went into administration to get out of recess duty, but I credit Rose Cosho and Claudia Seeley, who cared enough to inspire me to make new goals in my career.  During the two years of night school, I worked during the day as a Title I Reading and Math Specialist at Webster Elementary, which included me supervising fifteen paraprofessionals and teaching them strategies to work with students who needed extra instruction.  After earning my Masters of Educational Administration, I was assigned to be an assistant principal at Pleasant Green Elementary.  It was during that time that I was coached by the best, Sharon Prescott, the school administrator.  The following year, I became the principal at Woodstock Elementary.  After seven years I was reassigned to Hillsdale Elementary where I spent nine years.  I had accumulated enough years to retire but was too young and loved my work too much. I applied in Salt Lake City School District where I was hired to be the principal of Bonneville Elementary.  That was 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>During my 40 years as an educator, I have had many experiences and engaged with many adults and children.   I’ve learned from them all. </p>\n<p>Written by Donna Reid,<br />\nHappy and proud to be a principal!</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Find more articles in our <a href="http://www.slcschools.org/news/#.WK3LFBiZNBw">News Archive</a>.</p>\n	<p>“What do you want to be when you grow up?” a question asked of me many times during my early and adolescent years.  While nurse, stewardess, and mom were considerations, my answer, when quizzed, was always, “I want to be a teacher.”</p>\n	f	2017-02-09 10:32:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:43.904606-06	2017-09-19 13:09:55.410358-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b
776	a7cf8324-0196-4446-96d2-0ab5672fd129	Guest Author: Jeanne Winters Morriss, Backman Elementary	<h2>Why School Counseling?</h2>\n<p>The first week in February is National School Counseling Week, so this is a perfect time to reflect on the path that brought me to my job as an elementary school counselor at Backman Elementary. </p>\n<p>Before becoming a school counselor, I taught in the inner city of Washington, D.C., in a town of a thousand people in a rural farming community and in a suburban school in a mid-sized, Midwestern city.  The sweet students I met in these different worlds challenged me, made me work harder than I ever thought possible, made me laugh and filled my whole heart.  And sometimes, no matter how hard we worked together, their struggles – the sad, scary, worrisome things these little people brought with them to the classroom each day – kept them from learning.  My last year in the classroom, I taught a little girl whose mom had died in a tragic accident over the summer.  She was four and her dad was lost in his grief, so much so that he forgot to brush her hair most days.  So I bought hair ties, bows and a brush, and I did her hair every morning.  But in so many other ways, I had no idea how to help her overcome these painful emotions so that she could access learning in our classroom.  I went into school counseling with the hope that I could learn.</p>\n<p>When most people think about school counseling, they probably think of their high school guidance counselor, helping them meet graduation requirements and decide on colleges.  Most of today’s elementary and secondary school counselors shy away the title “guidance counselor” and the outdated images and job description that come with it.  Instead, we are school counselors -- advocates for students in every aspect of their school life, working to meet their social/emotional, academic, and college/career needs.  I love my work as a school counselor because I get to interact with students in so many ways.  This week, I spent time teaching a small group of 1<sup>st</sup> graders about empathy, listening to them giggle as they tried to guess what emotion group members were acting out.  I walked 3<sup>rd</sup> graders who had been fighting through our school’s Peace Path, and praised them for solving their problem.  I coaxed a little friend from under a desk and into my office where he used some of my favorite calming tools to take care of overwhelming emotions.  I played a game about goals with kindergarteners (How high will we make this block tower?) and marveled as they set, revised and reached the goal by changing strategies and working together.  Through our school’s College Bound Character program, I got to honor a student from every elementary classroom who displayed this week’s characteristic, Organization.  I met with a teacher and brainstormed a plan to help a student who was struggling behaviorally be successful in her class.  Even while doing the hardest part of my job, sitting with a student as she sorted through the hopeless, consuming feeling of wanting to hurt herself, I was overcome with gratitude that I could be there by her side. </p>\n<p>Ten years into my career in this profession, I have learned that I won’t have all the answers and I can’t take away a student’s painful feelings.  But through my work, I can be right by students’ sides, cheering them on and offering support, as they search for the answers and take care of the feelings themselves.  For this reason (and the ridiculous amounts of hugs, high fives and smiles I get every day), I feel lucky to call myself a school counselor. </p>\n	<p>The first week in February is National School Counseling Week, so this is a perfect time to reflect on the path that brought me to my job as an elementary school counselor at Backman Elementary. </p>\n	f	2017-02-09 10:31:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:43.988153-06	2017-09-19 13:09:55.607173-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

In the last couple of weeks, there have been a number of hateful acts that have occurred throughout the United States, including our state and our school district.</p>\n<p>Our schools are safe places where all students, faculties, staff, and community members are respected and valued. As we engage in dialogue with students and staff, regardless of political opinion, we must use this time to build a supportive and inclusive environment of critical thinking and educational discourse that educates our students.</p>\n<p>As we continue into the school year, promoting excellence and equity throughout our school communities, please remember our commitment to civility and positive dialogue. We must exemplify strength and empower ourselves and our students as we continue the vital work that we do with our children. Keeping students safe is our priority.</p>\n<p>It is at this time that we need to encourage a culture of positive discourse and monitor our behaviors as we continue to provide support, compassion and empathy to our students and colleagues. Regardless of hateful rhetoric and personal political opinions, we can all agree that they do not belong in our classrooms. We are here to nurture, support and provide a safe space for all students, staff and community members.</p>\n<p>Please note that we have no tolerance for discriminatory acts that occur.

774	2ed7ab4b-160b-41e7-a06e-926f0c445eed	Guest Authors: Nibley Park Students	<p>One of the first things you learn about film making is how much you have to work together. Sometimes it was easy and everyone agreed on what to do. Other times people just wanted to have their way on everything.</p>\n<p>In the fall, our 6<sup>th</sup> grade class make public service announcement. Each of us received a specific state to advertise on Adobe Spark. This was really entertaining because, not only did we have the chance to make our own video, but we also learned a lot about states. We could be as creative as we liked, which was a great way to spark our imaginations. We really enjoyed watching other students’ videos as well. This was a great opportunity that we should have more often. Everybody had fun and it was pretty easy as soon as you got the hang of it.</p>\n<p>In our 7<sup>th</sup> Grade AVID class we used on alone video program to make short videos. We were studying cells structure in science. Then we read an article about Henrietta Lacks. She was a black woman who died in 1951. She is interesting because her cancer cells kept growing and scientists still use her cells in science research. What is not fair is she never got any money for her contributions to science. Making the movies was a lot of fun and you had to reread the article a bunch of times to find out if what we put in our movie was factual.</p>\n<p>The filmmaking elective class started with us making films about ourselves. This is where we learned how important it is to write everything down. We had the job of taking notes of all the things we did and keep track of it because we would have quizzes or be questioned on some things. For example, we had to know types of shots and when and how to use them. We learned that an establishing shot is the first shot and it establishes the feeling and the setting for the film. The wide or long shot was fun because it captures everything you need to know and what you want your audience to see.</p>\n<p>Our second assignment was a big one. We made 30 second public service announcements. The topics were about lots of things including information about the environment, animal abuse, cyberbullying and LGBTQ. On this project we had film professionals come in and bring really professional film equipment. It was fun to learn how to use a boom and have really good movie editing software. We realized that using good equipment makes the job easier and faster.</p>\n<p>You can read some of the thing we learned in the list below:</p>\n<ul><li>When editing your video go through it multiple times to find any mistakes or incomplete areas that might not be finished.</li>\n<li>Make sure when editing and adding music to have it set the mood and relate to the point of your story.</li>\n<li>Add multiple shot styles to give more detail and variety to your film/project that you are working on.</li>\n<li>When doing a stop-motion, be sure to taking as many photos as you can to assure that you have what you need and that you have a backup in case something goes wrong or a mistake is made.</li>\n<li>Be sure to plan out your ideas and make a visual representation of them in order to get the best results afterword.</li>\n<li>Ask a teacher or mentor about something you may be confused on if you are unsure about something that you did during the film/project.</li>\n</ul><p>We were surprised about how good our films were; they were beyond our expectations. Even we were impressed with the quality of the films. We have ideas for projects we want to do in the future including messages to stop racism, and reminding everyone that even though we are all different we are the same. We found out making movies helps us remember more because we research and we keep reading our notes over and over. We couldn’t believe about how much filming it takes to make a 90 second public service announcement.  At first we thought, “Yea, we filmed it, let’s go!” Two weeks later we’d actually have a product.</p>\n<p>We like sharing our films with each other and celebrating our success. You can see our work at our exhibition in May at the Salt Lake Community College South City Campus.</p>\n<p><em>Authored by</em><br />\nTarik Becic<br />\nShade Conover<br />\nAeris Brouse<br />\nAndrea Banda-Garcia<br />\nTopaz Henderson</p>\n	<p>One of the first things you learn about film making is how much you have to work together.

Nate attended sixth grade at Parkview Elementary. He told the students about his upbringing and about how he was able to overcome challenges by enduring, and never giving up. He talked about the importance of being a team player and working hard to help your team succeed. He said, “When you are in a classroom, you are part of a team and your teacher is the leader. He/she will do whatever he/she can to help you succeed! You have to help your team by doing your best too.”</p>\n<p>He allowed students to ask him questions about himself and get to know him. They asked him things about his personal life, about how he overcame difficult challenges, and about his career. His responses were inspiring to students as they recognized the hard work he put into achieving his goals. He was enthusiastic about being here at Parkview, which brought a lot of energy to the room.

Roadrunner Days began several years ago with Principal Shelley Halverson as a way to promote school spirit and a community of caring characteristics. The PTA helped with her ideas and continues now with Principal Debora Cluff. </p>\n<p>According to the PTA chair, Jen Going, “Our hope is that all of the Roadrunner community can unite under the roof of respect and kindness at Highland Park.” Each day of the week the students had activities to help unite the school and community.</p>\n<p>Two of the activities included writing letters to members of the school and community (people like custodial staff, crossing guards, bus drivers, office staff, and paraprofessionals) and dressing up in Hawaiian attire and learning the true meaning of <em>Aloha</em>.  <em>The real meaning of Aloha in Hawaiian is that of Love, Peace, and Compassion – a life of Aloha is one when the heart is so full it is overflowing with the ability to influence others around you with your spirit.</em> The PTA provided each class with a book called <u>The Crayon Box that Talked, </u>and the entire school discussed the moral of it.</p>\n<p>“The moral of the story is that everyone is not the same and no one can finish a “picture” without others to help, says McKayden Frazier.</p>\n<p>“The story was about crayons in a box that didn’t get along. They kept fighting and eventually realize that each color is unique but once you put them all together they can do amazing things. This is like people because we are all unique but once we work together we do amazing things,” says Miles Little.</p>\n<p>The week was capped off by having each grade dress the color of a crayon and a school picture was taken. </p>\n<p><em>Author: Staci Rodriguez, Highland Park Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>Highland Park Elementary students showed their school spirit through acts of kindness during the week of Roadrunner Days.

He is the backbone of the highly functional school of 725 students and 40 faculty members. Any problem that is reported is taken care of immediately with confidence, honor, and reliability. A miniscule list of some of his duties would make anyone cringe: arriving daily by 6 am (sometimes 5:30 am if snow needs to be removed), picking up trash outside, making sure bathrooms are clean and operating correctly, mopping, adjusting desks, moving desks, assembly setup and take down, ensuring the safety of students by keeping an eye out for people who may not belong in the hallways or on school grounds, meeting with district personnel, etc.</p>\n<p>His duties are endless, but he never complains and is always going out of his way to help.

On October 7, Mountain View Students attended a Golden Rule Assembly to learn how to apply this rule through magic. Magician Steffan Soule focuses on the power of attention and how we can use our attention to apply the Golden Rule in a variety of situations. While demonstrating magic effects that visually relate to the curriculum, Steffan transfers methods for anti-bullying in an exciting, positive and educational assembly.</p>\n<p>So what is the Golden Rule?  Simply put, it’s “do unto others as you would have others do unto you.”  Sounds simple enough, but how does it play into building a safe and confident classroom?  It’s a principle that if we push to teach our students it can help make bullying disappear from our classrooms, if not our schools.  Bullying is a unique action, there’s no one reason why someone chooses to bully.  The reason for a child to bully other kids can vary for each individual.  What isn’t different though for each individual victim of bullying is the outcome, fear of it happening again.  This disrupts the safety of a classroom and wrecks a student’s “behavior balloon”.  Their attention will be elsewhere and not on what they need to learn. Soule related bullying to a balloon and its enemy– an 18-inch needle. He quickly popped the balloon with the needle. He then produced another balloon and slid the needle through the balloon. As students gasped, he told them they could avoid violence by standing strong. After that, the balloon didn’t pop, but disappeared. “We can make bullying disappear,” Soule said.</p>\n<p>At the end of the assembly Steffan talked about how the Golden Rule is inclusive of all different traditions, philosophies and religions. Different versions or formulations of the Golden Rule can be found everywhere: in religious and secular texts, works of art, song lyrics, the words of world leaders and more. Steffan than presented a list for each teacher to hang in their room to remind students to follow the Golden Rule and stop bullying.  A fifth grade student expressed how Soule gave a great message and feels more equipped to handle bullying and follow the Golden Rule. </p>\n	<p>How do we apply our attention to the Golden Rule to reduce “wrecking behavior” (bullying) and support “building behavior” in our classrooms?

It had a short parade route and avoided the heat of summer.  Both these factors assisted in reducing physical challenges to new marching performers.  In all, the event was a perfect match for Leland to introduce his students to marching band. It also was held on a Saturday which prevented students from missing classes.</p>\n<p>Once the Parade selection was made, Leland applied for some grants to obtain marching percussion instruments.  He taught students to march in a straight line and play an instrument at the same time.

I’m sure I would have found a way to success but Mrs. P pushed me that extra mile.”</p>\n<p>In 2015, the East High School AVID program and its graduates earned $1.3 million in scholarships, in 2016 however, the program and graduates reached $2.8 million in scholarship earnings, according to the program’s webpage, easthighavid.com.</p>\n<p><strong>About Somos UHCC Foundation </strong><br />\nSomos is the Utah Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 501 (c) 3 foundation dedicated to strengthening Utah’s Latino community through education, creating leaders by giving students opportunities to get educated, mentored and connected with local leaders.

Not only does the <em>Adelante</em> program reach out to their community and educational networks but also colleges/university departments reach out to <em>Adelante</em> scholars (i.e. Jackson students). For example, the Athletics Department from the University of Utah reached out to Dr. Jana Edward—Jackson’s Principal—and invited all grades K-6<sup>th</sup> to attend their First Annual “Future Scholars Field Trip Day” in November 2016 to experience a free Women’s Basketball game.</p>\n<p> There was a high response and enthusiasm to be a part of this Future Scholars event on behalf of the third, fourth, and fifth grade teachers to take their Adelante students. The Athletic Department was well organized in making sure that while youth watched the Women’s Basketball game students would connect sports with their academic curriculum.</p>\n<p>The Athletic department provided an educational packet for students to fill out throughout the game on subjects like Geography, Math, History, and Sports Science. Questions such as “We have three international players this season. What country are they from?” (geography), and “The Utah Women’s Basketball team will play the BYU cougars on Saturday, December 10<sup>th</sup>. (Its/It’s) going to be (a/an) awesome rivalry game! Make sure you bring (your/you’re) friends and family to watch” (grammar and spelling). In these two instances students had to read through the team roster in the packet and figure out where each team member was originally from and also consult with their peers as to which answers in the second question made their paragraphs grammatically correct. It was quite the adventure of having the students answer questions in the packet with such an intense women's basketball game!</p>\n<p>The UofU Women's Basketball team played against South Dakota and our Utah college team scored three times as much as the defending team. It was such a successful field trip because not only did third, fourth, and fifth grade classes were in attendance (totaling 125 Jackson students) but also because our youth witnessed great athleticism from a diverse of female undergraduate students at the U. Adelante students took all kinds of selfies with team players after the game, were able to take large color size posters of the winning team, and loved buying food from the concession stands. The students flashed the U sign often when female basketball players scored points and they won tons of prizes. It was an unforgettable experiences for our students and families.  </p>\n	<p><em>“Adelante promotes collaboration among many partners and high expectations so that our children can be successful from elementary school to the university.”<br />\n - Dr. Maria Franquiz, Dean College of Education, University of Utah.</em></p>	f	2017-01-04 08:24:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:50.890485-06	2017-09-19 13:10:07.918373-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Edison teachers are thinking outside the box to find engaging ways to help their students reach success.</p>\n<p>Recently, Edison students started helping each other with their reading goals. Ms. Alba's and Mrs. Riggs’s fourth-grade students have started to go to Mrs. Polson's and Ms. Johnson’s kindergarten classes once a week for thirty minutes. Each fourth-grade student is paired up with a kindergartener. Once they are paired up, the kindergartener will practice letter recognition, letter sounds, and reading fluency with fourth-grade student. After the kindergartener gets their reading practice done, the fourth-grade students read a book to the kindergarteners, which works on the fourth-grade students' reading fluency.</p>\n<p>By the end of the year kindergarteners are expected to know all of their letters and letter sounds, and Edison kindergarten teachers also have the goal of each student leaving kindergarten reading a book. Fourth-grade students are expected to read 115 words per minute. Pairing the students together is helping the students in both grade levels to meet their goals. Each fourth-grade student is working on their reading fluency when they are reading a book aloud and each kindergartener is getting immediate feedback when they are working on letter recognition and letter sounds. Ms. Johnson has already seen an improvement in her students.</p>\n<p>It is incredible that the students get one on one attention from each other. The pairing of students is also building a stronger community at Edison; both groups of students love working together. </p>\n	<p>Every grade level has reading goals that teachers strive for every student to meet.

How have they been in engaged for the past seven years? Through the Go Girlz Community Initiative, which is a program that was founded in 2004 at the University of Utah’s Women’s Resource Center with the intent to serve underrepresented populations: primarily minority groups and economically disadvantaged females between the grades 6-12 in the Salt Lake City School District. The Go Girlz Initiative has impacted girls at Jackson now for seven years and it is in great part due to Ms. Maggie Laun, Jackson’s school counselor.</p>\n<p>Ms. Maggie is an alumna from the University of Utah and has diligently worked with students and their families at Jackson Elementary for approximately nineteen years. Not only did Ms. Maggie graduated from the U, but she also worked with the Women’s Resource Center and developed significant relationships with faculty, department directors, and staff. She recalls, “Most of my connections [at the U] have been during my hikes. I’d say you know we need a program that caters to girls and then someone referred me to Kim” (personal communication with Ms. Maggie). Kimberly A. Hall, the Associate Director/Development Officer of the Women’s Resource Center became a close friend of Ms. Maggie and helped fortify the partnership between Go Girlz and Jackson Elementary students back in 2004. Jackson Elementary students and families are blessed with having a committed and influential advocate.</p>\n<p>In December, sixth-grade girls engaged in their last Go Girlz empowerment workshop that lead to discussions about what “Mean Girls” look and sound like, while also aligning those talks with Ms. Maggie’s word of the week: Acts of Kindness. During this discussion, other concerns arose that reflected the socio-political context that youth are experiencing. Personal and familial concerns such as safety, bullying, violence within their neighborhoods, homelessness, and the overall meaning of the right to vote. University facilitators were active listeners, advocates towards the girls' desire for more civic engagement opportunities, and caring responders towards the group’s concerns. Discussions that address the barriers that young girls face to being academically successful have taken place at Jackson Elementary for the past three months.</p>\n<p>Young girls participating in Go Girlz have conversations with University mentors on issues that are important to them, such as self-esteem, mean girl mentality, barriers to education, body image, gender roles, education, healthy relationships and more. The entire Jackson community are so committed to collaborating with the Go Girlz program at the University of Utah that our school was the only school in attendance during the Go Girlz Parent Night. Despite that the Parent Night was scheduled the weekend of Columbus Day weekend, Jackson bused seventeen sixth-grade girls to the event and had a blast!</p>\n	<p>Sixth-grade girls at Jackson Elementary have been mentored and supported by the Women’s Resource Center at the University of Utah since 2010!

Finally, AVID is not just being emphasized by the faculty, but the parents as well.  Parents of Mountain View students are volunteering their time weekly to check the student’s homework logs.</p>\n<p>In addition to teaching skills the teachers of Mountain View are busy creating an environment where students see the pride of life after high school.  Many of the classrooms and widows are adorned with banners and mementos of the teacher’s college of choice. </p>\n<p>With continued efforts to focus on skills related to AVID, just as many of the Mountain View Faculty have done, students will be immersed in social skills that are essential to developing habits and behaviors required to succeed in rigorous curriculum. </p>\n	<p>The implementation of AVID can clearly be seen as you walk the halls of Mountain View.</p>\n	f	2016-10-26 15:51:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:06.946717-06	2017-09-19 13:10:38.178017-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Everyone loves a short break to recharge for the school year; it can’t be any better! Or can it? Well, the East High Women’s Soccer team certainly did make it an even better weekend! The girls played against Timpview at Rio Tinto Stadium for the State Championship. Although it was a lost for the Leopards, the girls showed what comes from playing together as a team; 2<sup>nd</sup> place is a great accomplishment and all of us are extremely proud of our Lady Leps!</p>\n<p>Continuing along with sports’ successes, the East High Varsity Football team has demonstrated countlessly that they are more than just a high school team; they see themselves as one unit: a family. These values of unity and brotherhood help the boys shine through in the field. The team is currently still in the state playoffs with an undefeated record of 11-0. We wish these boys the best of luck in their effort to win another State Championship! They have shown the rest of the leap that there is no “I” in team and the wins happen when it is a group effort.</p>\n<p>The East High Student Senate doesn’t fall short from group-wide achievements. They put together what has been East High’s very best “Mix-It-Up” day on October 26<sup>th</sup> during both lunches. The idea behind this is to encourage the student body to sit with new people during lunch and celebrate the diversity found amongst our Leopards. Whitney Watchman, assistant principal, stated that “Senate was able to think outside the box and created numerous mini activities all around the lunch room. I have never witnessed so much student involvement. It was absolutely the best!”</p>\n<p>As if there hadn’t been enough to feel triumphant about, East High wrapped up the month of October with a spectacular Masquerade Ball! It all went down on Friday October 28<sup>th</sup> and the fun went from 8pm to 10:30pm. Groups and couples showed up in fun and unique costumes to celebrate not only Halloween being around-the-corner, but also to wind down from the end of the first term. This Masquerade was the best reward that our Leopards could have gotten as they completed ¼ of their school year. EHS Student Government came together and put in all their combined energy to deliver a fun-packed and celebratory night for everybody.</p>\n	<p>October certainly marked a month full of teambuilding opportunities for all the East High Leopards.</p>\n<p>One of the students and teachers’ favorite things about October is UEA weekend.

Not only are these students graduating early, but also some of them have been taking college classes alongside their high school classes to go above and beyond what is required for a high school diploma.</p>\n<p>Innovations is able to have the early graduation ceremony because students are able to move ahead and accelerate their own pace. Vice principal Tara Radmall led the celebration saying, “I am so proud of each early graduate and the great example they are. Each has impressive goals and plans after high school.”</p>\n<p> One of the early graduates is taking this opportunity to decide what she wants to do in the future. “Graduating early allowed me more time to explore my plans, I am more sure of my choices.” Emily Albrecht said about finishing early. </p>\n<p> This is not the first time Innovations graduated students early. Each year after the first semester the school holds an early graduation assembly to celebrate the achievement of students who have moved ahead and have decided to finish their course work early so they could move beyond high school.</p>\n<p> The assembly recognized the early graduates and asked each of them to give advice to the student body.  </p>\n<p>“Take advantage of what Innovations allows you to do, and work with your mentor,” Was the advice Casidi Chrysler gave to her fellow students. </p>\n<p>After the celebration one parent spoke with social studies teacher Megan Inama saying without the mentor program and the opportunities the school offers her son would not only have been able to graduate early but also graduated with honors and college credit. </p>\n<p><em>Author: Heather Bauer, Innovations Early College High School</em></p>\n	<p>Innovations Early College High School graduated 19 students in February, which was only halfway through term two.

As the school doors opened, students, parents, friends and siblings streamed into Hillside Middle School’s Haunted Hallways. While spook alleys have been a traditional fun Halloween activity, this spook alley has a unique purpose. Haunted Hallways provided key fundraising to supply food, clothing, and other support for Hillside students with financial need during the holidays and throughout the year.  Many of the attendees to the spook alley have come knowing this event provides this support.</p>\n<p>Dayna Evans, Hillside’s Family Involvement Coordinator and Student Government Advisor shared that student government members and parent volunteers decorated the halls.   Halloween treats and goodie were prepared to be sold during the event to add additional earnings. Once the halls were decorated, student government members had just enough time to put on spooky costumes, ready to provide chills and thrills for visitors.</p>\n<p>This year Hillside had some of the best attendance ever.  For the full duration of the Haunted Halls a steady flow of visitors enjoyed the creepy specters.  Darth Vader, Kylo Ren, and Rey from Star Wars were surprise guests at the entrance of the hallway, ready for group photographs opportunities.</p>\n<p>As a secondary support activity to Haunted Hallways, student body officers delivered big jars to classrooms for collecting spare coins students brought as a donation to supplement Haunted Hallways earnings.  A competition was set up between classes.  The class who brought in the most change won a celebration breakfast.</p>\n<p>At end of the night, Haunted Hallways, as if by magic (and with many helping hands) was converted back to normal.  Yet, Dayna has more for her students to learn about service. The student government has continued learning opportunities as they plan, create budgets, and shop for food, clothing and other items for children in need.  They have learned a powerful lesson about the importance and joy of assisting others. </p>\n	<p>At the end of a school day, on one October day, quiet and empty halls are transformed into dark, cavernous passages.  Young ghouls and zombies have been hidden throughout the passages awaiting their visitors.

She is in her first year of school counseling and wanted to be a counselor because she had a tough time fully believing in herself in school. According to Inez, “It took me a long time to believe in myself. I actually graduated from college, managed a business, and then decided to go back and improve my G.P.A. and get a degree in psychology. From there I found out about school counseling and decided my experiences could help me help others. I want to help encourage kids and let them know their brilliance and capabilities, while giving them the information they need so they don't have to go the long way like I did.” </p>\n<p>School counselors work on several layers throughout the schools. It is actually a fairly new career as far as education goes and for a long time teachers took on the role in addition to their already overwhelmed schedules. Now the school counselor position has moved to a comprehensive guidance system. School counselors reach students through classroom lessons, individual meetings, meetings with parents, supporting teachers, and running small groups. </p>\n<p>One of Ms. Lazalde’s goals this year is to encourage college awareness throughout the school. Most kids decide while they are in elementary and early middle school whether or not college is for them. She wants to help Escalante Students know that there are many different types of college programs and many ways to help pay for college. </p>\n<p>Ms. Lazalde is also helping to support a family and parent trainings group that meets weekly through Project Reality. </p>\n<p>Here is what she enjoys most about working at Escalante, “The best part of working at Escalante is the kiddos of course. They make my job a joy! A close second is the faculty and staff here at Escalante. They have been so welcoming and I am honored to work with them. I also want to mention the vibrant communities I see coming together. When I look around the school I see diversity in so many forms, and I watch the kids work together with cooperation, honesty, and compassion. It truly is a hopeful picture. I see the possibilities in every classroom I enter and know that I am looking at future educators, lawyers, doctors, scientists, and the list goes on. I am in awe of the potential. I can't wait to watch these wonderful human beings as they grow into their potential.” </p>\n<p>We are so happy to have her!</p>\n	<p>We are so excited to have Ines Lazalde join our school community.

Now they have access through their school libraries to books, e-books, and online resources.”</p>\n<p>Students at Bryant Middle School piloted the program last week. They were able to quickly log in on their phones or the school computers and to immediately begin reading some of the new titles and classic novels in the e-library.</p>\n<p>Over the next several weeks, teacher librarians will be working with students, teachers, and classes to help every student in grades 7-12 be ready to read all summer long. Students with a Salt Lake City Library card can also log in and use additional e-resources from the public library.

Herbert and Superintendent Sydnee Dickson issued the following statement on Friday, November 11, in regards to recent reports of student harassment in Utah schools:</p>\n<p>Over the past three days, we have received numerous reports of students throughout Utah being targets of harassment and bullying in our schools. Regardless of the motivation, we do not condone of this type of behavior.</p>\n<p>Students should feel safe in school. Harassment of any kind is not to be tolerated. These reported actions go strongly against American principles. Any form of bullying is inappropriate and can be extremely detrimental to the quality education Utah espouses. Every report of this type of behavior should be taken seriously by educators and parents.</p>\n<p>In Utah, we care about each other. As a community, we need to come together in supportive and safe environments. We encourage students to reach out in friendship and support to others, including those who may look, sound, or think differently than themselves. As a nation, we need more kindness, and we believe Utah can lead the way.</p>\n<p>Parents are advised that reports of children being harassed at school should be taken seriously and immediately communicated to an administrator. School employees and students are also encouraged to report instances of harassment and to actively promote a safe, positive environment.</p>\n	<p>Gov. Gary R.

Through the arts, our students learn to develop their point of view while respecting the point of view of others.</p>\n<p>Sponsored by our wonderful PTA and the Art committee, families enjoyed dinner, cool art activities, art auctions, handmade student art market and student musical performances. Community businesses also supported this event. Besides the 2-D art, our students, k-6 created ceramics, iPad art and incorporated LED lights with lithium batteries to combine science with art. Both floors of the school building were lit up with this artsy engineering.</p>\n<p>It was a joy to hear the students share their thoughts about their art to their families.</p>\n<p>“I love art because it’s something that helps you be happy if you are feeling down.

The school used funds from National Geographic, Ford Motor Company, and a Radical School Renovation prize to build a pond with surrounding gardens.</p>\n<p>The Utah Division of Wildlife Services declared the pond a protected wildlife habitat by stocking the pond with Utah Least Chub, a small minnow that is found only in freshwater sources in Utah! The Escalante population will be used to replace populations that are no longer reproducing.  They are a very important fish for the State’s ecosystem.</p>\n<p>From Tillie Uribe, a first grade teacher at Escalante and the pond coordinator, “Every grade level can use the pond to teach their life science curriculum as well as social studies curriculum. It is a great resource also for math, language arts, and art. The pond provides endless content and curriculum, everything from living to nonliving, life cycles, habitats, conservation, biomes, micro and macro organisms, and so much more. It also teaches history of geologic formations of the valley and of Lake Bonneville. Weights, measurements, and data collection is also great to teach with the pond. The possibilities are endless!”</p>\n<p>The pond presents opportunities as well as challenges over time, including plumbing and filtration issues, and like many water sources in Utah, an overgrowth of invasive species of plants. Ms. Uribe has worked hard with the DNR, the Salt Lake School District, and Wasatch Desert Gardens to get the pond back in tip top shape so that the fish can thrive. The district has contracted with Wasatch Desert Gardens to completely upgrade and redo all plumbing and pump circulation systems, as well as to remove the invasive plants and upgrade plant life and beautify the pond. The entire area around the pond is being re-landscaped to include an outdoor classroom area for teachers and students to learn. Several hundred species of native and aquatic plants are being planted, enhancing fish habitats. There will also be a release valve placed off of the upper pond pump for fertilizing the school gardens with nutrient rich fish waste.  </p>\n<p>Because of all of these wonderful community partners, the gardens and pond will be a resource not only for students and teachers at Escalante but also the neighborhood and community groups.</p>\n	<p>In 2004, Escalante Elementary students worked with Machelle Dahl and Heather Aiono to solve the soggy soccer fields. They discovered that the playground had been built on top of natural artesian wells.

The amazing Leopard PTA came together to make East High’s first-ever Homecoming Carnival a reality! The carnival occurred on Monday, September 19<sup>th</sup>, 2016 from 5pm to 7pm. This was a marvelous opportunity for students, faculty and administration to put forward their best effort and help improve the bridge between the high school and the neighboring community. The carnival brought in all sorts of visitors; young and old in age, newcomers and old-timers to the area, and participants or spectators of the fun happening all around! It was truly the best way to undertake East High’s 103<sup>rd</sup> Homecoming festivities.</p>\n<p>The leopards didn’t stop there in regards to leaving their best print in the community. The bi-yearly events that really bring the students, the teachers, and the parents together is the Parent-Teacher conferences. These provide the opportunity for everyone involved to work towards success and empowerment of all students. The Parent-Teacher conferences occurred on Wednesday, September 28<sup>th</sup> and Thursday, September 29<sup>th </sup>with an average of 1,287 parents visiting each night. The availability and involvement at these conferences really speaks tremendously of not just the teachers and staff, but also of the community that surrounds our students. It’s awesome to witness the number of people who wish nothing but a bright future for these kids.</p>\n<p>The prints left behind during this month wouldn’t be complete if we didn’t have some made specifically by the students themselves. The East High Girls Varsity soccer team really showed their community of fans what they can do! It was on Thursday, September 29<sup>th</sup> when the “Under the Lights” rivalry game was scheduled; Highland Rams against the East High Leopards. This is certainly a defining duel that occurs every year and, though families and friendships may be at odds because of it, the truth lies in who goes home with a victory. This year, the lady leps took the win 1-0 over the lady rams with a great game to show for it. The East High crowd left Highland’s stadium with very much pride. </p>\n	<p>As the back-to-school rush settled down, the East High leopards were in for an impactful month ahead in September.

I know it’s the key to growing up right.” These are the first two lines from Dr. Seuss’s Reader’s Oath. Last week, students, teachers and administrators had a wonderful time celebrating Dr. Seuss on Read Across America Day. NEA's Read Across America is an annual reading motivation and awareness program that calls for every child in every community to celebrate reading on March 2, the birthday of beloved children's author Dr. Seuss (nea.org).</p>\n<p>Assistant principal Kaleb Yates went around to many classrooms to read Dr. Seuss books dressed up as the Cat in the Hat. He read several different books, such as Green Eggs and Ham, I Am NOT Going to Get up Today!, One fish two fish red fish blue fish, and Oh, the Places You’ll Go! Each class was able to vote for 1 or 2 books that the Cat would read. Students enjoyed interacting with the stories and choral reading the rhymes they heard. Of his experience, Mr. Yates said, “The kids absolutely loved seeing The Cat in the Hat in their classroom! There were a lot of smiles and laughs and it was a great way to celebrate and honor one of the greatest authors in history!”</p>\n<p> Happy Birthday Dr. Seuss!</p>\n<p><em>Author: Aly Miller, Parkview Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>“I promise to read each day and night.

750	a9df6252-f6ad-4c7d-9eff-e163ddadbf15	Guest Author: Greta Asay, Student at Clayton Middle School	<p>When most people think of middle school art classes, they think of an art class where you paint, create clay figures, and sketch. But that isn’t the beginning of Clayton’s art classes. Here at our school, we are offered a variety of art classes, such as dance, choir, band, orchestra, theater, photography, multicultural crafts, and, obviously, your typical art class. Many students enjoy participating and watching these diverse kinds of art.</p>\n<p>Although there are many reasons, the main reason why so many students like these different kinds of art is because besides having fun, you also learn a lot from these classes. In addition to learning, exploring, and practicing the art, you also learn important life skills that will help you throughout your life. From participating in these art classes, you learn how to work well with others, meet new people, communicate more effectively, listen to others and follow their instructions, and present your talents in appropriate ways. These skills are incredibly important, and I know that many students, myself included, are grateful for learning so much from just an art class.</p>\n<p>The arts at Clayton Middle School are very great because the quality of the class is amazingly high, you learn important and valuable life skills, and you have fun but still learn about the art. Our art classes are an essential part of Clayton and our staff, teachers, and students love participating and supporting them.</p>\n	<p>When most people think of middle school art classes, they think of an art class where you paint, create clay figures, and sketch.

The project is now in its third year and Escalante Elementary was chosen for this year’s special holiday experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning</strong><br />\nThe planning for this complex event began all the way back in May. Rob has an invaluable assistant, Shawn Bair, and together with staff from the Salt Lake School District they identified a school, planned appropriate activities which can vary depending on the size of the school, and found additional financial support from Utah businesses. Funders this year included various private donations and support from Influence Realty and Relocation, Big-D Construction, Energy Solutions, Utah Broadband, Ampian Staffing, Acclaimed Home Warranty, and the RSL Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>The Day</strong><br />\nBecause Escalante has a slightly larger student body than past schools, things were changed up this year. Instead of a trip to ride the train, they enjoyed a special screening of the movie Polar Express complete with popcorn and drinks. They then returned to Escalante to find it had secretly been transformed into the winter wonderland of the North Pole by volunteers and staff. They were greeted by Santa who, with the help of teachers and volunteers, gifted each of them a gift that they had chosen. Many an eye teared up as the students sang together, “This is My Wish.” In addition to cookies and a pair of mittens for each child, the school was gifted a fantastic set of indoor soccer gear from Real Salt Lake. As students headed back to class there was laughter and cheering, and quite a few phrases of, “Best school day ever!”</p>\n<p>Thanks to the work of Rob Corcoran and all of the other businesses, District staff, Escalante teachers, staff, parents and numerous volunteers, the Escalante kids received a special holiday experience to remember forever. </p>\n	<p>In December, Escalante students and staff took an express trip to the North Pole thanks to generous support and the leadership of Rob Corcoran, owner of Influence Realty and Relocation.</p>	f	2017-01-04 08:06:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:51.558643-06	2017-09-19 13:10:09.221131-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Governor Michael Leavitt declared the centennial school in 1994 and we also happened to turn 100 years old that same year. To celebrate, all the students and staff got to put their handprints on the pillars and write their names.  Some of those students now have their own children at Emerson today. It is fun for them to show their kids their handprints. Students and faculty today proudly wear their Emerson established 1894 T-shirts each week!</p>\n<p>At one time, Emerson was the largest school west of the Mississippi.  It actually began in a two room home on Emerson Avenue.  This is how it got its name. Enrollment increased and eventually the students would attend school upstairs and their moms would learn sewing and childcare in the basement. As the school grew, more space was needed and the school changed locations. </p>\n<p>In 1979, they rebuilt Emerson.  It was during the time that there was a big push for Energy Efficient and Earthquake safe buildings.  The architects received awards for the design and it was the model for schools.  We are the only building like this in our district with a single level and no windows.  Our atriums are the only source of natural light which is somewhat of a complaint to teachers and students these days.</p>\n<p>The old school was located where the playground now exists.  McClelland Circle was a through street and the playground was where our building now sits.  As the new building construction was being completed, the blacktop playground was made on the rooftop where the basketballs courts were located.  A chain link fence with circular razor wire around the top enclosed the “playground”.  The roof leaked and they re-tarred it a few times. It didn’t hold up to all the play from Emerson students. After the old building was demolished, they created the new playground for students. </p>\n<p>In 1991, we had over 750 students enrolled and had portables on the playground, the music classes were in the hallway, on the stage during PE and pull-out Extended learning program (ELP) met in the supply room in the office! </p>\n<p>In 2010, our school was remodeled, lighting and flooring were changed; Smart boards &amp; LCD projectors were installed in each classroom and new classrooms were added on the east side of the building.  We have continued our conservation practices at Emerson just as our building was designed for.</p>\n<p>We are a leader in the district for our recycling program. Emerson parents and students contribute by providing a walking school bus for students to safely get to school each morning without vehicle emissions in our environment. Emerson has a “green team” to promote and facilitate environmentally friendly practices. Each year, fifth grade students promote a “be idle free” campaign through their service learning. Emerson is home to a beautiful community garden, where students learn about plants and green spaces.</p>\n<p>As the year begins it is nice to reflect on the history of Emerson as faculty, students and staff start the new school year and continue the legacy of Emerson Elementary.</p>\n	<p>Did you know that Emerson Elementary is one of the oldest schools in Salt Lake District?</p>\n	f	2016-10-19 10:54:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:07.35615-06	2017-09-19 13:10:38.971385-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Hillside Middle School has a robust college and career readiness program. For the seventh-grade students, we have the College &amp; Career Awareness class.   The eighth-grade students have additional lessons to teach students how to connecting career dreams to high school core and elective courses along with many other lessons.  One capstone activity in Hillside’s college and career awareness exploration is a designated day in December where seventh-grade and eighth-grade students have a career based fieldtrip or activity day.</p>\n<p>Eighth-grade students go on a fieldtrip to Highland High School and the Salt Lake District Career and Technical College.   The fieldtrip was started several years ago by CTE teacher Kathy Phipps, district CTE coordinator Elaine Toronto, and school counselor Cari’ Fifield.  It has quickly become a favorite activity.   School counselor Marcy Arellano-Brown continues to coordinate this activity with support from Anne Martin and Connie Wyckoff who are current district CTE coordinators.  While on this fieldtrip, students see demonstrations to learn about Career Technology Education and also about career pathways.  They learn how these courses and pathways can help them in career preparedness, college readiness and in some cases, obtaining technical certificates.  Some of the classes that students see are Companion Animal Science, Forensic Science, Fire Science, Welding, Woodworking, Foods and Nutrition, Barbering, Medical Assisting, along with many others.  This experience helps students have a better understanding of possible electives they may choose in high school to enrich their college and career readiness.</p>\n<p>While our eighth-grade students are on this fieldtrip, the seventh-grade students are at Hillside participating in a Career Day Activity.  This activity is coordinated by our CTE teachers Jeff Streba and Kimberly Platt.  Students are divided into groups and see a variety of career presentations.  Guest presenters who work in a large variety of industries such as health sciences, information technology, engineering, protective services and many others will help students begin to expand their knowledge of careers.  Seventh-grade students also attend an assembly about careers working with animals and complete a mini-engineering tower building activity. </p>\n<p><em>Author: Cari Fifield, Hillside Middle School</em></p>\n	<p>One of the many responsibilities of a middle school is to offer college and career awareness exploration activities for students.

With the addition of peer tutors, there are more opportunities for her students to take classes like art, choir and even Spanish; thus helping them discover more of a real world experience.  The peer tutor helps ensure adequate support so the student with disabilities can be successful.</p>\n<p>The best part of all is to see the bonding that happens between the child with disabilities and the peer tutor.  There is a true friendship formed.  Jared Edwards, another teacher of a Hillside’s special education program explained, “The students all learn to look outside themselves. The peer tutors are additionally kind and respectful of all students, and they look out for the students with disabilities.  You can see a difference in the hallways with students who are peer tutors.”</p>\n<p>On any given day you can walk around Hillside and see peer tutors playing a toss game with one student with disabilities.  Another will be helping a student in a wheel chair go on a walk.  You can stop by a science classroom and see peer tutors and students with disabilities working together, learning together, and building their fantastic friendships.  It is a magical relationship that can last throughout the year and can extend into the community. </p>\n<p>Teachers of the special education programs share stories about their students coming to school excited to talk about seeing a peer tutor friend while shopping.  Aly Hill shared, “My students with disabilities have a great amount of respect for peer tutors who are both friends and role models to them. They sometimes want to listen to their peer tutors even more than a teacher.”</p>\n<p>In addition to the friendships that are formed, another wonderful thing is happening.  The teachers of the special education programs are not just supporting the friend-shipping and bonding of the peer tutor and the child with disabilities, they are also supporting academic advancement for both. Peer tutors are asked to journal and answer reflective learning questions throughout the semester. Peer tutors will also work with the teacher of the special education program to design learning units that align with a specific student’s identified academic goals.  The peer tutor will teach the completed lesson to their “friend” and assigned student. It all makes for an amazing experience.</p>\n<p>Corrie Bacasa, another teacher of a Hillside special education program surveyed her students to see how peer tutors describe the impact of peer tutoring on their academic skills.<br />\n <br />\n“I have become a better problem solver.”<br />\n“It helps me be more confident and responsible.”<br />\n“It's made me have to spell out almost every word and has helped with my spelling.”<br />\n“It has taught me to stay more focused on what I am working on.”</p>\n<p>Students and teachers report other side benefits for peer tutors and students with disabilities.  The friendships help students see beyond the disabilities and start seeing abilities. </p>\n<p>Teachers:<br />\n“It helps shy students become leaders.  It builds self-confidence.”<br />\n“It helps students get out of their comfort zone.”</p>\n<p>Students:<br />\n“I have learned that a small, ‘Good job,” can make someone’s day.”<br />\n“I have learned there is no difference between us.  All of us are human beings and long to be friends.”<br />\n“Everyone should be treated the same no matter what, and I’ve learned to make friendships with each kid.”</p>\n<p>The effect of this class lasts long after the experience is over.  The social skills and the increased confidence will be far reaching into the life of each student.  One former peer tutor reflected many years after her experience that “one of her most influential teachers was a special needs teacher she peer tutored for in the eighth grade. It was then [she] learned of her talents for caring and for others. This teacher’s important lessons of compassion and love still inspire her to show those same characteristics to the children with whom she works.”  These lessons will create memories and skills for a lifetime. </p>\n	<p>Hillside Middle School students have developed some unique friendships through an elective class called “peer tutoring.”</p>\n	f	2016-10-04 15:04:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:08.675702-06	2017-09-19 13:10:41.808853-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

McMann spoke of how she was inspired by the cuts to her children’s arts program at school. Questioning the logic of depriving children of creativity, she began to imagine a land where creativity was punishable. Thus was born The Unwanted Series. McMann also discussed her newly released book: <em>The Unwanteds Quest. </em>McMann also told students about her collaboration with her son on the artwork for the series.</p>\n<p>Students at Bonneville loved hearing about the origin of these characters and their adventures. We are very grateful to Lisa McMann for visiting our school and sharing her writing process with us. </p>\n<p><em>Author: Elise Maxwell, Bonneville Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>On February 6, 2017, Bonneville Elementary students had the privilege of meeting Lisa McMann, author of the Unwanted Series.</p>	f	2017-02-07 11:03:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:44.43047-06	2017-09-19 13:09:56.407904-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Today at Franklin Elementary students experienced their first fire drill of the year. Most of the students did quite well at lining up and getting out of the building quietly and quickly. A few of the younger students were a bit concerned there was a real fire. These students were quickly and kindly reassured by classmates and teachers.</p>\n<p>The drill went well and all students, teachers, and staff were accounted for. Thankfully, it wasn’t a real fire. The older students enjoyed getting up and outside, especially on such a nice day.</p>\n<p>Each month students take part in either a fire drill, earthquake drill, or lock down drill. Last year, we experienced our first real lock down, and thanks to our drills the students knew just what to do. There were no students who felt anxious or frightened because they all had been taught how to respond to a lock down.</p>\n<p>These drills are an important part of our school emergency preparedness plan. The students learn quickly how to respond correctly when they hear either the alarm or information regarding a lock down.</p>\n	<p>Each year our schools conduct drills so students know just what to do in the event of an emergency.</p>\n	f	2016-09-06 15:55:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:10.170866-06	2017-09-19 13:10:44.564514-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

These middle- and high-school students earned the right to compete in this prestigious academic competition by winning their categories at the Utah History Day state contest in April.</p>\n<p>Six thousand Utah students in grades 4 through 12 participated in the History Day program this year.They represent Utah communities from Tremonton to Monticello, Price to St. George, along with the Wasatch Front. Of this number, only 61 qualified to compete at the national level. Salt Lake County’s national delegates are:</p>\n<ul><li>Jacob Simmons, Albion Middle School. Documentary: “St. Eustatius: The Exploration, Encounter, and Exchange that Won the Revolution”</li>\n<li><strong>Mia Yu, West High School. Historical Paper: “China-US Ping-Pong diplomacy: The Beginning of a New Era”</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Lucy Myers, Clayton Middle School. Website: “The World’s Columbian Exposition”</strong></li>\n<li>Ella Sjoblom, Olympus Junior High. Historical Paper: “We Can Do It!: American Women and Their Unforgettable Encounter with the Military and Workforce in WWII”</li>\n<li>Isis Tupola, Camille Wilkins, Hunter High School.

To do this, I will read an article with information about learning targets and success criteria.</p>\n<p>At Parkview, we decided to focus on learning targets and success criteria for this school year. What that means is we are extremely specific in each lesson about what our students should know by the end of a learning block (the learning target) and what they need to do to be successful (success criteria). This focus has helped us as teachers narrow our focus for each lesson and rely heavily on the state standards for each subject area. Having a learning target and success criteria has also helped our students take more ownership of their learning. It has also given them a road map for what they need to know and how they should demonstrate their understanding.</p>\n<p>The learning target and success criteria you read in the first paragraph let you know what you would learn, why you’re learning it and how you’ll be successful. This is the goal for all students by the end of each lesson. The way learning targets and success criteria are written is different in each grade, but the goal is the same. If you go into any classroom at Parkview, you’ll see learning targets and success criteria posted around the room and displayed for students to know and remember.</p>\n<p>Another component of our EBIS is feedback. Teachers have focused on providing students with helpful and timely feedback. This emphasized the success criteria and helps students recognize whether or not they have reached the learning target. There are also many opportunities for students to give feedback to their teacher. This lets teachers know how confident students are about specific content. It also gives the teacher an opportunity to adjust instruction as needed.</p>\n<p>Now, go back to the learning target and success criteria to check your success! Today I will learn about Parkview’s Evidence Based Instructional Strategy, so I can better understand what goes on in classrooms school-wide. To do this, I will read an article with information about learning targets and success criteria.

The two sisters designed and built a digital prosthetic arm which earned them the first place award at the State competition held at Physics Day at Lagoon last week. Jasmine and Karina will represent Utah by competing in the National MESA competition against the top teams across the nation.</p>\n<p>Their completed arm was put through a series of tests: throwing balls into a bucket, moving items of different sizes into a container, and manual dexterity and accuracy.</p>\n<h4><strong>State Math Competition</strong></h4>\n<p>West High students placed in several categories in the recent State Math Competition.</p>\n<p><u>Individual Awards:</u><br />\n9th grade 4th place - Chenkai Luo<br />\n9th grade 5th place - ?Zach Barnanell</p>\n<p>10th grade 1st place - Joshua Speckman (highest overall score in state for 10-12th grades)<br />\n10th grade 5th place - Mitchell Simmons<br />\n10th grade 6th place - Juyoung Kim?</p>\n<p>11th grade 1st place - Annie Yun<br />\n11th grade 2nd place - Rohan Jairam</p>\n<p>12th grade 3rd place - Benjamin Barker?

Her research involved power production.</p>\n<p>Batteries tend to contain an <em>electrolyte</em>, a liquid which transfers an electrical current through the device. That liquid tends to be corrosive and sometimes flammable. Kathy came up with a way to replace it with a putty-like paste. It’s so <em>viscous</em> that her batteries won’t leak. Designers won’t need to put such thick walls on these batteries, to resist breakage. That, in turn, means her devices can be much lighter in weight.</p>\n<p>And because her pasty electrolyte is based on plain old table sugar, it’s fairly cheap to make. Another benefit: Gram for gram, the new material holds more energy than regular electrolytes. In Kathy’s research, she made small coin-sized batteries like those found in watches and calculators. The new pasty electrolyte in each of them costs only about 10 cents to make, she estimates. And unlike many batteries, hers could hold a full charge even after recharging them more than 1,000 times.</p>\n<h4><strong>State History Fair</strong></h4>\n<ul><li>Lucy Myers from Clayton Middle School won First Place in the Junior Individual Website competition.</li>\n<li>Mai Yu from West High School won First Place in the Senior Historical Paper competition.</li>\n<li>Ashwaq Abdi, Gilbert Lopez, Emiko Church,  and Sophia Wrathall from the Salt Lake Center for Science Education won Third Place in the Senior Group Website competition.</li>\n</ul>	<p>Salt Lake City students have won awards in several recent prestigious competitions, including the MESA National Engineering Design Competition and the State Math Competition.</p>\n	f	2016-05-19 15:06:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:11.108941-06	2017-09-19 13:10:47.256177-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b
929	85d6ef47-c76a-43e5-99dd-95e63cb215ad	A New Mural at Escalante	<p>During the 2015-2016 school year our visual art specialist worked with students and volunteers to complete two murals in our front hall. There was wonderful support from teachers, staff, our PTA, and a generous anonymous donor.</p>\n<p>Three fifth-grade classes headed up the project. They were responsible for developing the theme and sub themes, painting, getting parent participation, and whole school k-6th grade participation in illustrating the themes.</p>\n<p>Our overarching theme was about school success, not only what does it take to be successful in school, but what does it look like when we tell that story visually. Some of the sub themes are families, teachers and school staff, school readiness and classroom behaviors, exploration, persistence, a willingness to take risks and think in new ways, being curious, and finishing well.</p>\n<p>Over the course of three months the fifth-grade students gathered illustrations of these concepts from the entire school population and their own families. They worked on small teams to create scripts and classroom presentations for k-6th grade classrooms, explaining their project and inviting kids to participate. They judged the 500+ drawings that were submitted for consideration and choose a few from each grade level that best illustrated their theme. They also drew at home with their parents and worked on portraits to be considered for the section on loving families.</p>\n<p>All of these drawings were then placed into a design that was approved by faculty, staff, and the PTA.</p>\n<p>And for the next six months we painted. The resulting mural, two 10 x 30 foot walls, shows us not only what our fantastic students and families look like, but how they render visible the things that are important to all of us about successful students and schools. It reflects the joy and zest for learning and life that exemplifies our school community.</p>\n	<p>A new 60-foot mural at Escalante Elementary paints the picture of school success.</p>\n	f	2016-10-03 11:40:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:09.090475-06	2017-09-19 13:10:42.381933-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

The students took classes from expert guides about Silver Lake’s wetland environment.  While there, they became scientists who explored and learned about the plants and animals in our own backyard. </p>\n<p>After the trip students can now tell you that one example of an animal that lives around Silver Lake is the beaver, who “peels the bark off trees because the inside is like the inside of a banana.” Students also looked for squirrels that “eat pine cones a lot like people eat corn on the cob.”  One student exclaimed, “I learned that the moose doesn’t have any front teeth; he just puts his mouth on the beginning of the branch and slides his mouth to get the leaves off [to eat].”</p>\n<p>The field trip to Silver Lake was an innovative way to support the fourth-grade curriculum, which includes spotting and recognizing signs of animals and learning about the water cycle. Students also learned about topics such as watershed, macro invertebrates in healthy water, and drinking water for the Salt Lake Valley.</p>\n	<p>Highland Park Elementary fourth-grade students recently took a trip to Silver Lake, a chance to learn outside the classroom.</p>\n	f	2016-09-29 10:42:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:09.518058-06	2017-09-19 13:10:43.075779-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Valeria Bergera, our principal, welcomes students and parents back to school and lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.</p>\n<p>Following the ceremony outside, parents join us in the gymnasium to learn our school rules; Be Safe, Be Responsible and Be Respectful as well as other school procedures. While parents enjoy some time with the principal in the gym, students go to their new rooms and get started on a first day of school project.</p>\n<p>Parents then have the opportunity to come around to their child’s room to see where his/her child sits, meet the teacher and learn about class expectations. This is a wonderful opportunity for parents to check in with their child, be introduced to the teacher and get a feel for their child’s new environment for the next school year.</p>\n<p>Parkview Panthers are thrilled to be back at school and can’t wait for the learning and growing that will happen in 2016 and 2017!</p>\n	<p>Each year on the first day of school students, families, and employees gather to raise the flag at Parkview Elementary.</p>\n	f	2016-09-23 10:57:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:09.666166-06	2017-09-19 13:10:43.382081-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Thus, many of the students cannot afford graphing calculators, which cost about $120 per calculator. Utah math core standards, as approved by the State Board of Education, expect all students to have access to technology, including graphing calculators. As such, the school needs to purchase calculators to give all students access to technology by checking out graphing calculators.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay for teachers and paraprofessionals</strong><br />\nTo offer targeted intervention during the school day, the school needs a paraprofessional in the classroom with the math teacher. This will allow the teacher to pull small groups of students together to re-teach concepts they may not understand. In order to offer intensive interventions after school, the school will need to pay teachers to work longer hours. This intervention works with individual students who are still unsuccessful after the in-class targeted instruction. Data and common assessments will be used to identify students and to track their growth. Teachers will collaborate to design short weekly assessments and invite students to the interventions either during class time or after school.</p>\n	<p>Today, the Tesoro Foundation presented a $66,000 grant to West High School to help improve the school’s overall year-to-year math SAGE scores, by providing additional in-class and afterschool tutoring for students. The additional tutoring is focused on the incoming freshman class.  The grant has two parts: first, $23,000 for the tutoring and second, $43,000 to purchase graphing calculators, whi</p>	f	2017-01-24 15:22:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:47.669829-06	2017-09-19 13:10:02.163032-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Brightly colored art projects focusing on everything from seeds to magnetic fields lined the halls. The school’s three science teachers set up experiments in the keva, teaching science concepts to students as curious parents stood near. Students and families played math games with decks of cards and created headbands with the phases of the moon attached. Community partners lined the main lobby, offering everything from assistance with health care to science displays. In the cafeteria, after enjoying pizza with family, students could pose in a kayak for a picture, an opportunity designed to help introduce families to the idea of kayaking and canoeing on the Jordan River that runs behind Backman. Students even had chances to interact with snakes and a hermit crab as part of the nights festivities.</p>\n<p>In the auditorium, families beamed as they watched students in kindergarten, second grade, fourth grade and fifth grade perform science-related dances. During weekly movement classes, students use kinesthetic learning to review concepts such as heredity, the solar system, habitats, simple machines, matter and electricity. Then they use their knowledge of these concepts to create dance movements. At family night, students performed these dances for families. These dances and the other events of the night helped Backman students move full STEAM ahead toward their learning goals.</p>\n<p><em>Author:  Jeanne Winters Morriss, Backman Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>Science, technology, engineering, arts and math could be spotted at every turn at Backman Elementary during their recent STEAM-focused family night this spring.

The class, taught by Ryan Arp and Heather Bauer, is a semester class where students can earn two credits and finish the whole year of the respective courses. The class meets everyday, and students read literature associated with historical time periods and events.</p>\n<p>Bauer has said collaborating with Arp has been great. “I love this class,” she said. “The students get excited about the material and it is great to see them learn and come up with their own opinions about America.”</p>\n<p>Sophomore Yllandra Baum, one of the Building America students, says she enjoys the class and said she would recommend it to other people. Arp and Bauer also do a social ethics class at the beginning of each semester which can count for half of language arts 12 and half a credit of a social studies elective.</p>\n<p>Another example of collaboration is science teacher Chris Walter and math teacher Darilyn Merrill were able to combine a chemistry concept with a math concept. They did a simulation of Rutherford’s Gold Foil experiment with marbles. Through this, they learned more about probability as well as atomic structure.</p>\n<p>Junior Isaac Griss Salas attended the lab “It was a riveting experience,” Griss Salas said.</p>\n<p>Teachers are also working with Bauer and other language arts teacher Dana Savage to have essays for science and social studies count for final language arts essay. “If a student is already writing an argumentative essay for chemistry and I require an argumentative essay, I see no reason why they can’t turn in that essay from chemistry,” Savage said.</p>\n	<p>During the 2016-2017 academic year, Innovations Early College High School teachers have started doing cross-curriculum collaboration which is benefitting students. One of the main examples of this being done is a Building America course that combines US history and language arts 11.</p>	f	2017-01-09 09:39:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:49.957067-06	2017-09-19 13:10:06.08452-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

The foundation is the only one of the eight Google Fiber Fellowship locations nationwide to be selected for two fellowships. One reason for the selection is the foundation has demonstrated it has the expertise, skill, and commitment to take on the challenge of narrowing the digital divide in the Salt Lake City community.</p>\n<p>The Web can open doors for people by providing access to jobs, education, social services and more. Yet, more than 60 million people across the United States aren’t connected to the Internet. Of special interest to the foundation is that the Internet is home to a wide variety of educational resources, which can be used to increase student achievement and bolster parent involvement in Salt Lake City School District schools.</p>\n<p>Through the Digital Inclusion Fellowship, the foundation will collaborate with Google Fiber and the Nonprofit Technology Network (NTEN) to create programs that will help bridge the digital divide. The foundation will select fellows who will embed within the organization for one year, enhancing a new digital literacy program hosted at the Glendale-Mountain View Community Learning Center.</p>\n<p>The foundation plans to use one fellow to help parents learn the digital skills necessary to navigate through the educational resources and information offered by the district and its schools. Those resources include electronics gradebooks, school and district websites, and electronic means of communication with the schools and teachers. The second fellow will focus on training adults in the community who can then become the digital literacy trainers for others. The fellowships are for one year, but sustainability is a key goal.</p>\n<p>“The foundation is committed to assisting students and their families in succeeding academically,” said Michael Williams, Chief Executive Officer of the Salt Lake Education Foundation.  “It is critical the parents of our students have the requisite knowledge, skills, and training to access their students’ progress and communicate with teachers and school administrators online. With this Digital Inclusion Fellowship we are excited to work with Google Fiber and the Nonprofit Technology Network to move our efforts forward.”</p>\n<p>“We’re looking for emerging local leaders who are passionate about helping people in their community,” said Andrew Bentley, Google Fiber’s Digital Inclusion Program Manager. “Through the Digital Inclusion Fellowship, these leaders will have the chance to work with organizations that are committed to getting more people online. We’re excited about the projects that the Salt Lake Education Foundation and their fellows will lead, and the impact they’ll have on closing the digital divide in Salt Lake City.”</p>\n<p>Applications for the year-long fellowships are now being accepted.

Mrs. Leaver, a former 6th grade teacher at Highland Park, is taking all of the small toys students donate to Panajachel, Guatemala in February. She gave class presentations to upper grade classrooms, and the students decided to "do something to help these kids who don't have many things," said one fifth-grade student. During the presentations classrooms learned how people in Guatemala live and some of the similarities and differences they have to Utah citizens. "It was interesting to see what they do and I feel grateful for what I have," said another Highland Park student. </p>\n<p>Mrs. Leaver says, "Guatemala is a country rich in culture, but lacking resources we take for granted. I believe it is important for children to understand that there are children all over the world that do not receive an education due to a lack of resources. Children should know that they can in fact make a difference in other’s lives, one step at a time. Put the seed of hope in a child’s heart."</p>\n<p>She previously visited Guatemala on a similar mission trip where she donated the unclaimed lost and found items from Highland Park.

Salt Lake City School District will receive ongoing support from the Center for Green Schools over the course of the next year and will benefit from connections with a broad network of school sustainability leaders.</p>\n<p>“It is truly an honor to be selected to participate with this elite group of sustainability minded managers from school districts located throughout the country,” said Greg Libecci, Salt Lake City School District’s Energy and Resource Manager.  “I hope to contribute some while I plan to absorb and learn much. This is a great opportunity for me to bring back best practices that will save taxpayers money while demonstrating responsible stewardship of our finite natural resources.”</p>\n<p>“Salt Lake City School District is truly deserving of the recognition and support this program provides,” said Rachel Gutter, director of the Center for Green Schools at USGBC. “In the coming year, Salt Lake City School District will benefit from professional development opportunities, increased exposure to the vast network of other school districts striving toward the same goals, and the chance to grow in their roles with support from the Center for Green Schools. They know that where we learn matters, and they are devoted to creating schools that are healthy, that complement curricula and that engage students every day.”</p>\n<p>Specific benefits available to scholarship recipients include participation in the School Sustainability Leaders Summit, an annual event that convenes staff responsible for sustainability programs from school districts large and small, giving them direct access to resource conservation managers, energy managers, facilities directors and other industry experts. Scholarship recipients are also provided fully-funded travel to the Greenbuild Conference and Expo, ongoing professional development support and direct access to the nation’s leading green school experts throughout the year.</p>\n<p>To broaden the impact of the scholarship in the selected school districts, 100 teachers from each district will be offered an opportunity to take USGBC’s Green Classroom Professional certificate course. School districts may also take advantage of LEED certification coaching, in-person sustainability workshops and district-wide sustainability master planning.</p>\n<p>Studies have repeatedly shown that improving specific aspects of a student’s classroom environment leads to better memory, attention, concentration, task speed, and more. The School District Scholarship program allows administrators to evaluate and plan for changes system wide and to elevate the level of the conversation in their communities regarding green school design and operation.</p>\n<p>There are five recipients of School District Scholarships this year. The scholarship for Salt Lake City School District is funded through the Center for Green Schools, thanks to generous sponsorship from United Technologies Corp.

The Salt Lake City Police Department (SLCPD) knows that, and they helped reinforce that message to students at Riley Elementary. </p>\n<p>The SLCPD donated books to Riley Kindergartners that they can keep in their home.  Police Chief Mike Brown and his unit of officers read a picture book to all  Kindergarten classes.  He shared how his love of reading began in the home with Dr. Seuss by pulling out his well-loved and worn copy of <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> and then encouraged the children to graduate from high school.  Riley students were delighted to pick a book of their liking.  </p>\n<p>Scholastic’s Kids &amp; Family Reading Report found that children from lower income families are far less likely to read books outside of school.  Over ninety percent of Riley Elementary students participate in the Free/Reduced lunch program, and many families do not have the financial resources to build a library of books for their home.  A big shout out goes to the Salt Lake City Police Department for being advocates of literacy in the home.  The Riley school community greatly appreciates the SLCPD’s outreach in promoting the love of reading through their book donations!</p>\n	<p>Becoming a good reader is the one of the most essential skills needed to be successful in life.

Currently, there are over 15 schools within Salt Lake School District that are implementing the practice.  Restorative practices are being used in several school districts around the nation. </p>\n<p>The propose of restorative practices is to proactively build healthy relationships and a sense of community in order to prevent and address conflicts and wrongdoing. Typically, when a student breaks a school rule, the student is talked to by the school’s administration, the parents are called, and the student might be placed in in-school or out-of-school suspension for the day. This old style of discipline does not address the underlying needs of the community that was harmed or the needs of the student who committed the harm.  Instead, restorative practices focus on meeting individual needs as well as restoring the relationships of all that are involved.   </p>\n<p>Restorative practices begin with circle discussions which allow each person who was involved in the incident to be heard. This part of the process teaches listening, respect, and problem solving. All stakeholders are able to contribute to the conflict resolution so relationships can begin being repaired. Northwest Middle School is in the process of training students to offer mediation as part of this process.</p>\n<p>Next, the student who committed the harm is given time to reflect on his or her choice. In order to take responsibility for their action, the student must understand how their behavior affected others, must acknowledge that the behavior was harmful to others, and must decide what action is needed to repair the harm.  Additionally, the student must make necessary changes in order to avoid such behavior in the future.</p>\n<p>The student is encouraged to express remorse and offer community service to those who were harmed. For example, if a student puts another student down through gossip or a verbal conflict, they could write a letter of apology to the individual who was harmed and write a reflection paper on how it feels to be put down or gossiped about.  Or if a student damages school property through graffiti the student could help clean, repair, or repaint the area. </p>\n<p>Restorative practices build the social-emotional skills of recognizing and managing emotions, the development of compassion for others, and helps to establish positive relationships.  It leads to responsible decision-making and teaches students how to handle difficult situations constructively.</p>\n<p>“Restorative practices allow individuals who have committed harm to take full responsibility for their behavior,” says Erik Jacobson, vice-principal of Northwest Middle School. “The practice focuses on the repairing of relationships.  Overall, it is a more positive process.”</p>\n<p>Through restorative practices, Northwest Middle School along with other Salt Lake City schools, are fostering a culture of care and belonging while inviting responsibility and accountability.  Restorative practices are a more effective way for correcting student behaviors while helping students build-life long relationship skills</p>\n	<p>Northwest Middle School along with West High School and elementary schools Backman, Escalante, Meadowlark, Newman, North Star, and Rose Park are working together to implement restorative practices.

Watching students enjoy reading, get excited to read, and teach other students how to read is the best.</p>\n<p>At Whittier Elementary, Tony Madsen’s fifth-grade class and Meherban Khalsa’s and Brooke Lee’s first-grade classes have created strong friendships through reading. They get together once a week for 20 minutes of engaging reading and support. First, the fifth-grade student pair up and read books in the Joy Berry series that teach social and emotional skills. They include: Let’s Talk About Lying, Fighting, Tattling, Being Rude, Feeling Angry, Feeling Scared, etc., and help students understand how to solve problems and deal with emotions in healthy ways. Students point to the words to help the first-graders recognize print and words better through proper pronunciation.</p>\n<p>After 10 minutes, the students switch roles. The first-grade students get their leveled books and read to the fifth-grade students. The classes look forward to serving each other every week. It creates excitement in the first-grade students to show “their buddy” how well they can read each week, and the fifth-grade students learn the importance of helping others. Additionally, “Hey, buddy” resounds in the hallways when they see each other. These teachers have been doing this for three years and look forward to many more in the future.</p>\n	<p>Watching students read books is good. Watching students enjoy reading is better.

All students who attend Bennion Elementary and Lincoln Elementary, regardless of income level, are eligible to receive one free breakfast and one free lunch each day they attend school.  Free and reduced meal benefit applications will not be collected at these two CEP school sites.</p>\n<p>More information about CEP can be found in the links to the right or by calling the Child Nutrition Department at (801) 974-8380.</p>\n<p>Children/households who/that are currently approved for food stamps, Family Employment Program (FEP), or Food Distribution Programs on Indian Reservation (FDPIR) may be certified directly by the appropriate agency.  These households will be notified of their eligibility and that their children will be provided free benefits unless the household notifies the school that it chooses to decline benefits.  Food stamp and FEP households should only submit an application if they are not notified of their eligibility by a specified date determined by the school.</p>\n<p>To apply for free and reduced-price meals, households should fill out the application when they register their child/children for school.  Parents are encouraged to apply online for free and reduced priced meals at <a href="http://www.slcschools.org/departments/child-nutrition/Free-and-Reduced-Meal-Application.php">http://www.slcschools.org/departments/child-nutrition/Free-and-Reduced-Meal-Application.php</a>.

Every 5th and 6th grader also has the option of taking band, strings and general music. All the arts specialists have been trained to integrate their art specialties with classroom curriculum so that core subjects are being reinforced through the arts as well as knowledge of and appreciation for music, dance, visual art and drama. The money for these arts specialists, including the art teacher, dance specialists, drama teacher, and music teachers, comes from grants and the money raised at the Arts Night fundraiser. </p>\n<p>The annual fundraiser hosts dinner to hundreds of families and people in the community. Students from every grade perform a few songs throughout the night and several businesses donate goods and services to be silently auctioned off.  Students from every classroom in the building prepare an Arts Night Project that is also sold off in the silent auction. Projects range from individual pieces of artwork, large chalkboard of the USA, to hand painted zentangle pattern canvases.  There were hands-on art and music stations set up for kids to create projects during the evening too. Parents from each class put together themed baskets that are given away at the end of the night to some lucky students in attendance. </p>\n<p>Students in first grade sum up their reasons why they love the arts. Brookelle says, “I like art because you can make lots of things, like a bird, a face and a bug.” Eli says music class is his favorite because “it makes me feel happy.”  Ava prefers dance. “I like dance because I get to do cartwheels.” The Highland Park Arts Night Committee made up of parents and teachers runs the entire Arts Night. </p>\n<p><em>Author: Staci Rodriguez, Highland Park Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>The Highland Park school and community came together Friday night in mass to help fundraise at the 12th Annual Arts Night.  Highland Park Elementary is a model school for the arts and is one of the few schools in the nation that provides visual art, music, and dance to all students.

Free student meal benefits do not transfer with the student when they transfer out of a CEP school.</p>\n<p><strong>How does a school qualify for CEP?</strong><br />\nOn April 1, the district identifies students who directly certify for free meal benefits through programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program/Food Stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Head Start. Household applications for free and reduced meal benefits cannot be included in the calculation. </p>\n<p>The percentage of identified students (IS) enrolled at a school is multiplied by the factor 1.6 to determine the percentage of meals that will be fully reimbursed by the federal government. A school district may elect to participate in CEP when a school’s IS percentage exceeds 40 percent. However, the mathematical breakeven point for 100 percent federal reimbursement at the free meal benefit rate is 62.5 percent identified students (62.5 x 1.6 = 100%). Salt Lake City School District reviewed its student data, determined the IS percentages at Bennion and Lincoln were very close to the breakeven point, and selected the schools to participate in the CEP program for the 2015-16 school year.</p>\n<p><strong>About CEP</strong><br />\nThe Community Eligibility Provision within the National School Lunch and School Breakfast program helps low-income children have access to healthy meals at school.  Established in the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, CEP is a proven tool to ensure students in high-poverty areas are fueled up and ready for school.

More than $875,000 is being distributed to 131 school libraries across the country. Bryant Middle School is the only school in Utah to receive this award.</p>\n<p>Emily Dejong, MLS, the school’s Library Technology Teacher, went after the grant to provide students and teachers at Bryant Middle with up-to-date, current information text and fiction. Ms. Dejong is adamant about the critical role the library plays at her school, “The Bryant library provides a safe space for exploration and discovery. Our students deserve access to materials that encourage this curiosity for learning. This grant will help us offer a greater variety of resources so the library remains relevant for all our students.”</p>\n<p>“Our staff, community partners, and parents feel it is important for the school’s commitment to improving education to be continuous and genuine,” said Bryant’s Principal James Yapias. “The Laura Bush Foundation for America’s Libraries will directly impact our school by empowering students to be better readers and to take responsibility for their learning, personal growth, and actions.”</p>\n<p>Having a high-quality library with access to a highly qualified librarian has been proven to improve students’ reading and writing levels. School libraries provide students with support and resources to complete academic assignments, research for personal interests, and read for pleasure.</p>\n<p>“It’s important that we see libraries as dynamic learning resources, not static archives,” said Tiffany Hall, District Library Supervisor. “Students need access to updated, current, and relevant resources for personal and academic study and growth.”</p>\n<p>The Laura Bush Foundation for America’s Libraries provides grants up to $7,000 to the nation’s neediest schools so that they can extend, update, and diversify the book and print collections in their libraries, with the goal of encouraging students to develop a love of reading and learning. Since its inception in 2002, the foundation has awarded over $12.5 million to almost 2,500 schools across the country.</p>\n	<p>Bryant Middle School has been awarded a $7,000 library grant from The Laura Bush Foundation for America’s Libraries.</p>\n	f	2015-06-10 10:02:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:16.417894-06	2017-09-19 13:10:58.403152-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Families worked with their children to pick a family member who was important to them, either someone from several generations back or a living member of the family. They used a worksheet to gather the information and, when possible, also found pictures.</p>\n<p>The students then brought this information to school and worked on portraits of the ancestors on small wooden tags to be hung on the tree. Their own words about their family members were used to create an elegant paper chain. All of this was put together by these three teachers and the tree was donated to the Festival of Trees in support of Primary Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>According to Victoria Bruno who organized the student participation, “I wanted to do this particular project with my students because I believe that it is important for students to give back to their community. Through this project, the students were able to learn about their ancestors and help the children at Primary Children's Hospital. Service is something that everyone can do no matter what age.”</p>\n	<p>Three third-grade classes at Escalante have spent the past six weeks creating a beautiful “Ancestor Tree.”</p>	f	2016-12-14 13:12:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:40:55.107554-06	2017-09-19 13:10:16.662107-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

In 2008, Utah began to pilot a new computer adaptive testing system. Its success led the Utah Legislature to establish a statewide computer-adaptive system in 2013-14. This system is known as SAGE and was developed with help from AIR, the American Institutes for Research.</p>\n<p>SAGE is a unique-to-Utah system of assessments designed to support and measure success and growth. SAGE tests are adaptive and a step up from “fill-in-the-bubble” assessments. This means students can see different questions based upon previous questions and answers, e.g., students who are struggling will get easier questions to help keep them moving forward and students breezing through the exam will get harder questions to help keep them involved.</p>\n<p>Individual student SAGE results are available from your student's teacher. State, district, and school SAGE results are available on the <a href="https://datagateway.schools.utah.gov/Assessment/SAGE">Utah State Office of Education website</a>.</p>\n<h3>PACE Report Cards</h3>\n<p>The Governor's "On PACE 66% by 2020" initiative seeks to increase the state's educational performance to reach the 66 percent benchmark. The vision is that at least two-thirds of Utahns ages 20 to 64 will have earned a postsecondary degree or certificate. The "PACE" acronym represents initiatives to achieve the following by 2020:</p>\n<p><strong>Prepare young learners </strong><br />\nKey metrics: 90 percent proficiency in 3rd, 6th and 8th grade reading; 90 percent proficiency in 3rd, 6th and 8th grade math; and 100 percent of high school seniors taking the ACT test.<br /><strong>Access for all students</strong><br />\nKey metrics: a 90 percent high school graduation rate; 80 percent post-secondary enrollment rate; and elimination of waiting lists in required courses.<br /><strong>Complete certificates and degrees </strong><br />\nKey metrics: 13 percent of the workforce will have board approved certificates; 14 percent of the workforce will have associates degrees; 28 percent of the workforce will have bachelor's degrees; and 11 percent of the workforce will have graduate degrees.<br /><strong>Economic alignment</strong><br />\nKey metric: 90 percent of graduates will be employed in their fields of study.</p>\n<p>PACE Report Cards also include information on federal accountability standards. Formerly called the Utah Comprehensive Accountability System (UCAS), this section of the PACE Report Cards are required by federal standards and break down testing rates by grade and student ethnicity.</p>\n<p>PACE Report Cards for your school are available on the <a href="https://datagateway.schools.utah.gov/Accountability/PACE">Utah State Office of Education website. </a></p>\n<h3>School Grades</h3>\n<p>School grading is an attempt to measure school effectiveness and issue a single letter grade for each public school in Utah, based on several factors and a complicated formula. However, there are legitimate concerns that a single letter grade does not provide an accurate picture of our public schools. Other tools such as the PACE Report Cards and School Improvement Plans provide a much more comprehensive look at public schools.</p>\n<p>Your school's grade is available on the <a href="https://datagateway.schools.utah.gov/Accountability/SchoolGrades">Utah State Office of Education website.</a></p>\n<h3>School Improvement Plans</h3>\n<p>For Salt Lake City parents who want a comprehensive look at their schools, we encourage them to review the school improvement plans. These plans are developed and reviewed on a yearly basis to meet the individual needs of each school. They can be found on the <a href="https://apex.slcschools.org/apex/f?p=553:1:">district’s website</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n	<p>In Utah, there are several ways to assess public schools and several reports available to parents.</p>\n	f	2015-01-06 12:02:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:41:19.388909-06	2017-09-19 13:11:04.429268-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Mrs. Mecham determined the folktale the students started with and then the class got to work.</p>\n<p>"As a class, we determine the scenes that need to be depicted to present the story as an opera. We worked together to compose the lyrics for the opening song.  That song sets the tone of the opera.  We looked for meter and strong, descriptive words within the story to create the framework of the song's verses and chorus. We used rhyming dictionaries to help us develop our lyrics," explains Mrs. Mecham. The students then move into groups to write songs for the rest of the scenes. </p>\n<p>"We were careful to determine the mood for each song. As with the opening number, the student groups identified a melody to accompany their lyrics," says Angela. One of Highland Park's music teachers, Mrs. Jen Purdy, is an integral part of the process.  </p>\n<p>This is the sixth year Angela and Jennifer have collaborated together on a student-centered opera.  After starting the process with the students, Mrs. Purdy helps the class get their melodies accurately recorded on paper and then adds a full accompaniment.  Jen says the students walk away learning a lot of reading and writing skills as well as increasing their music skills identifying mood and form, creating melodies and lyrics, singing, and performing. </p>\n<p>After writing the complete opera, it goes into production, with auditions for lead parts, practice, scenery and costumes. "Finally, we perform our opera for our families and friends," says Angela. "What sweet satisfaction."</p>\n<p><em>Author: Staci Rodriguez, Highland Park</em></p>\n	<p>Mrs. Angela Mecham's third-grade class at Highland Park just successfully wrote songs and performed a musical based on The Coat of Patches, an old Yiddish folktale.

Students are looking forward to having jobs as Lagoon staff, lifeguards, professional sports players, teachers, inventors, pilots, business owners, artists, doctors and scientists.</p>\n<p>“I Love You This Much,” is an opportunity to remind each other why we really come to school- because we care about our school community and the larger community we represent.

It can also be used by parents to reinforce what students learn at school with homework. The strategies are useful, succinct, and can be used any time. Hammon recently released her second book, BALD, a picture book based on a true story. This “how to” book gives ideas for families who have someone with cancer. It uses humor and fun along the way and is a delightful book that is written with great love and perspective. </p>\n<p>Geoff Griffin’s book, Brooklyn Bat Boy, was released earlier this year. It is a historical fiction children’s book based on the life of Jackie Robinson. The selection of words is mouth-watering and allows readers to transport themselves back in time. Bobby, the main character, will also take you on a journey you will never forget. The sounds and smells of the baseball games will be felt and heard.

Edison has even turned student incentive programs into fun Harry Potter rewards. One Harry Potter reward that Edison students can earn is called Head Master Honors. Head Master Honors is the ultimate reward. Every Edison teacher tries to hand out one Head Master Honors Ticket every week. Edison teachers are always looking for students that are working hard, making good choices, and are following school rules. Our school rules are: right place and ready, following directions, respecting property, making it better than before, using kind words and actions, and honoring personal space. </p>\n<p>When a student gets a Head Master Honors Ticket they take it to the office. The office staff will call their parents and let their parents know what their child did to receive this honor. The student then gets to pick a number and their name is written in a box on that number on a chart (the chart is hanging on the wall by the front office doors). The object of the chart is to get ten students names in a row. Once ten students’ names are all in a row, those ten students get to go to lunch with the principal, assistant principal, and one teacher. Our students are lucky enough to get to go to a restaurant and order a delicious lunch. Students love receiving the reward of Head Master Honors; they work very hard for it. Head Master Honors is just one more magical way Edison staff is motivating students.</p>\n	<p>Edison is all about Harry Potter this school year.

This program is “dedicated to closing the achievement gap by preparing students for high school, college and a career.” Teachers learn strategies to help students with skills and behaviors that will help them be successful in academics and provides a sense of hope for personal achievement through hard work. AVID has supports for helping students improve their writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization, and reading.</p>\n<p>The focus Parkview has decided to master this year is organization. Every student has a binder with color coded tabs and folders for each subject. Students use their binders as a reference for information about each subject. Here you will find anchor charts, two and three column notes and student work that shows mastery of the skills they’ve learned. Students also have planners and homework folders to keep their homework organized.</p>\n<p>As the goal of the program is getting students ready for college, each class in our school has chosen a university to study and represent. The teachers and students at Parkview have written to their universities to tell them of our goal to get students ready to be successful at their school. We have had a great response. Many schools have sent merchandise from their college, showing their support.  The students and teachers are working hard this year to learn habits and strategies to be college and career ready!</p>\n	<p>There is a great energy at Parkview Elementary this year because we have adopted the Achievement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program.</p>	f	2016-11-16 10:37:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:41:04.05594-06	2017-09-19 13:10:32.082618-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Students are ready to learn again in under 15 seconds.</p>\n<p>High expectations, student engagement, and student learning are all key components of Peggy Lowe’s first-grade class at Whittier Elementary. The students know what is expected and can describe what they are learning in each center. Some are working on math concepts, while others are working on words and reading. They are engaged the full ten minutes and ready to rotate at the sound of the timer. Everything operates like a well-oiled machine.</p>\n<p>In addition, Ms. Lowe is working with students one-on-one for a couple of minutes to increase reading fluency and comprehension. She is encouraging and supportive with each child’s needs and one can tell she has a love for teaching and each of her students. Watching her manage, teach, and influence children in such a positive way would make any parent proud and want to sign their child up for her class. First-graders are once again in good hands. </p>\n	<p>Timer rings. Students quickly move. iPods, worksheets, books, computers.

As one of the school-wide goals for improving our overall discipline program, there are many new components that have added quite a bit of interest for the students.</p>\n<p>Students can randomly earn a Principal’s Bug Slip from any mysteriously chosen adult in the building by being ready, responsible, respectful, or safe.  This slip enables the student to come down to the Principal Club Window and pull out a stick with a number and have his/her Bug Slip placed on the 300 Board which includes the targeted behavior exhibited.  The student’s name is written in the Celebrity book.  When ten names are filled up in a row, the entire group gets a “Mystery Motivator.” Two such motivators have been silly string battle and bouncy ball recess. </p>\n<p>Other great rewards are when students are given Outstanding Certificates and the copy is taken home to show their families something they have done as a leader in their classrooms or in the common areas.  We are working on increasing student leadership skills like being proactive, working cooperatively, and pulling our clips up in our classroom to the tops of the charts with outstanding behavior.</p>\n<p>In every classroom, students are chosen as students of the week. Their certificate and picture are displayed at the front of the school for the week.  A student is chosen as student of the month from each classroom. These children have a chance to “spin the wheel” where they win such prizes like they could become principal for the day, eat lunch with Mrs. Cluff, or sit all day in the Principal’s Chair!  Their name is also put in the school newsletter.</p>\n<p>Mrs.  Cluff says, “We are working towards having clear expectations school wide.  When students know what is expected in all areas of the school, they are able to meet the expectations.  We want to recognize our students for the positive ways in which they contribute to our school both academically and behaviorally.  Students have responded positively to the changes.”</p>\n	<p>Highland Park is moving its discipline program in a positive new direction this year!

Yvette and Marty started “Project Book Bag.”</p>\n<p>The dynamic duo collected in donations and purchased over 40 empty backpacks to outfit the Nibley Park Dolphins. Marty and his Grandma did not stop with just backpacks.  They solicited help from 100 friends, family, and coworkers. An overwhelming supply of pencils, pens, erasures, tissues, bandages, and more were soon stuffed inside the bags. Nibley Park students got all of the things to remind them of the joy of going back to school.

Highland Park has created a student leadership team who has begun to help run our school’s activities. The team is comprised of representatives from grades second through sixth who were nominated by their former teachers as students who exemplified leadership qualities like being proactive, cooperative, and putting important things first. </p>\n<p>“I am thoroughly impressed with the extraordinary leadership skills these students have. They are natural leaders and are clearly ready to rise to the occasion,” says Mr. Sorensen, Principal Intern who helps guide these students. “It is our goal to see student leadership become even more student guided. I can see it getting to the point where there will be very little need for adult guidance. As students become more comfortable in their leadership roles I can see them taking the initiative to create new opportunities to promote excellence for the entire student body.”</p>\n<p>With the help of Ms. Amber Pulley, Ms. MaryJane Moore, and the administration, our student leadership team has started to lead the school assemblies, create a TV broadcast program for the school, and help plan other whole school activities like our recent jog-a-thon.  “We implementing the student leadership team to increase student voice in our school,” comments Mrs. Cluff, our Highland Park Principal.</p>\n<p>These students also met over the past summer with Mrs. Cluff and a few staff members to create school expectation videos like how to behave in the lunchroom, halls, and bathrooms.</p>\n	<p>Highland Park has created a student leadership team, which helps run school activities.

You can spot Mr. Winters and his hat on our campus in the morning, at lunch and after school, helping students to stay safe and be on time.  Right from the start, Nibley Park recognized Mr. Winters as a most interesting and helpful fellow.  He values education for children and for himself. He has two degrees in completely different subjects. He is a University of Utah graduate Mechanical Engineer, and he is also a U of U graduate in Fine Arts. He uses both of those knowledge sets to make Nibley Park an interesting place. For example, one year he sponsored a Chinese New Year Parade including a beautiful dragon the children operated. Mr. Winters speaks Mandarin and taught us how to say “Happy New Year” in Chinese. He built the Yellow Submarine and helps students build real buildings with snow! Mr. Winters would love to start an intermural snow sculpture competition.</p>\n<p>Mr. Winters teaches free guitar lessons on Tuesday afternoon. To have guitar lessons, you must have guitars, so Mr. Winters rounded up guitars through generous donations from our families and others.  Some of the guitars were in need of tender care. Sure enough, Mr. Winters, the engineer-artist, had the guitars fixed up and sounding great in no time. He sponsors a basketball free throw tournament, where students can advance to state competitions. He builds sets for music and art productions, and Mr. Winters is a philatelist. Yes, you heard right:  He is a stamp collector! He found a wonderful sponsor who comes to our school to teach all kinds of things using stamps!

Students learned that they will be earning Green Bucks all year long to spend at our end of year carnival through exhibiting positive behavior both in the classroom, and also throughout the school. The more positive behavior displayed, the more they earn! Our focus this year is to help students learn positive behavior through a combination of rewards and restorative justice practices. Studies show that using restorative justice practices leads to more positive outcomes for students than a more punitive approach.</p>\n<p>The Ensign Library also has a carnival theme: Step Right Up to the Ensign Library. Carnivals and libraries have a lot in common; both are organized, both have something for everyone, and most importantly, both have a dash of magic. Carnival performers use hard work and perseverance to develop the abilities and skills to astound crowds. In honor of these positive attributes, we hope to instill and inspire creativity, discovery, curiosity, and excitement for learning in our own students.</p>\n<p>The Ensign library is an amazing space to aide in this goal. Today’s learners live in a world saturated with information and are actively intrigued by new things. During their class time in the school library students will learn to choose the materials that are just right for them and explore the world of information literacy in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p>Every January, we have a giant school wide read/fitness-a-thon, and we are already hard at work preparing this carnival themed event.

All of the extra hours of work, all of the struggles our students endured, all of our students’ hard work paid off. It might not be an Olympic gold, but it is victory for Edison.</p>\n<p>Edison Elementary was named the top performing Title 1 school in the Salt Lake City School District for the 2015-2016 school year. This is a huge thank you and achievement for the staff and students of Edison Elementary. The truth is every staff member and student at Edison gives 110%; every teacher that returns to Edison every year comes back for the incredible students.</p>\n<p>There are multiple reasons that Edison students were so successful last year. From the hard work of each teacher and student to programs administration put into place to motivate students. Every teacher has a way to encourage their students to work hard and do their best. Edison students also have the administration creating programs to motivate them. One program that administration created is called Edison 85.</p>\n<p>Edison 85 is a program that encourages students to work hard and do their best on testing. If Edison students score 85% or higher on district interims students get a t-shirt that reads Edison with the number 85 on the back and students are allowed to wear the t-shirt to school instead of their uniform shirt. Our principal Dr. Laurie Lacy and our assistant principal Carolyn Synan actually walk around to every classroom, congratulate each student, and hand out the t-shirts. So the students are not only receiving a t-shirt but the administration is telling them how proud they are of their hard work. The student love receiving this honor and it motivates them to work hard and do their best.</p>\n<p>We have all heard the saying it takes a village to raise a child and the same is true for educating children. Administration, teachers, para educators, and parents all take part in educating children and helping them reach success. We all are humbled to have a banner hanging in the entry way of our school, it symbolizes the hard work our village did last year. We are very proud and working even harder to get another banner for the 2016-2017.</p>\n	<p>Edison Elementary is beaming with pride, after being named a Top School in the district.</p>\n	f	2016-10-07 09:42:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:08.261292-06	2017-09-19 13:10:40.962213-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Every student will receive a new book to kick-off their summer reading. Dav Pilkey, the best-selling author of <em>Captain Underpants</em> and the <em>Dog Man</em> series, is awarding one new book for every student to one school in every state this summer.</p>\n<p>The contest is sponsored by the 2016 Scholastic Summer Reading Challenge that encourages kids take a “summer leap” into books and keep reading all summer. This year’s theme for the Scholastic Summer Reading Challenge is "Be a Reading Superhero." Parents and educators can learn more about the challenge and sign up kids to participate at <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/summer">www.scholastic.com/summer</a>.</p>\n<p>"Summer reading is a critical part of a student’s academic development. Students need motivation and they need access to good books they want to read over the summer," said Emily DeJong, Bryant’s Library Technology Teacher. Bryant Middle School also partners with The City Library to get students involved in summer reading. "The City Library has a fantastic reading program for children and young adults that helps motivate them to read over the summer. This award will provide students with a great book that they choose for themselves to take home."</p>\n<p>"When it comes to kids and reading, there’s no such thing as a guilty pleasure," said Dav Pilkey. :Even though I struggled with reading growing up because of my dyslexia, I was fortunate to have parents who encouraged me to choose the books I wanted to read: silly books with tons of illustrations that made me laugh out loud. And if it weren’t for these books that motivated me to keep turning the page, I wouldn’t be the writer I am today. Summer is a great time to discover the fun and joy of reading and I am honored to be the global ambassador of the Scholastic Summer Reading Challenge campaign."</p>\n<p>To learn more, go to <a href="http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/SummerReadingChallenge">http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/SummerReadingChallenge</a> and follow #SummerReading on social media.</p>\n	<p>Bryant Middle School has won the Dav Pilkey ‘Be a Reading Superhero’ contest.</p>\n	f	2016-05-03 10:58:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:11.52877-06	2017-09-19 13:10:48.186415-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

It was their 6th annual Fun Run.</p>\n<p>Prior to the actual event, Indian Hills students enjoyed an intense workout with DJ Rob and our PTA President, Lisa Johnson, at the Fun Run Kick-Off Assembly.  Lisa Johnson took charge while DJ Rob gave the beat.  Students learned sleek dance moves to help strengthen their bodies and minds! </p>\n<p>Student’s got a chance to raise money for the school through local and community donations over the course of one month, prior to the Fun Run.  This is the school's largest fund raiser for the year, with 100% of the money raised going straight back into the school.  The funds raised help support the school science program, classroom teachers, and contribute to many other programs. </p>\n<p>On the day of the run each grade level had a chance to stretch with live music from DJ Rob before heading out onto the field to run or walk laps.  With the generous support from our parent volunteers, students stopped for a water break along the way.  After laps were completed, each student was given a refreshing banana to refuel and a goodie bag donated from local vendors. Once individual and class donations are tallied, the school hold will hold an assembly to recognize the students with the highest donations obtained. </p>\n<p>This community, this school, and its students are #STRONG!</p>\n	<p>Indian Hills students recently had a chance to get fit and help raise money for the school at the same time.</p>\n	f	2016-10-06 09:52:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:08.490548-06	2017-09-19 13:10:41.477923-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Through their #ThanksTeach social media campaign and their Limeades for Learning project, SONIC is raising money to assist teachers in their classrooms. SONIC also partnered with Donors Choose to find a way to get assistance directly to teachers. As a result, SONIC today donated over $69,000, which will be used to fund every teacher project in Salt Lake County currently on the Donors Choose website.</p>\n<p>Today’s announcement came as a surprise to two teachers at Washington Elementary School in Salt Lake City. Ms. Hymas and Ms. Crisher both have current projects on Donors Choose that are now funded thanks to the donation from SONIC. Salt Lake City School District Superintendent Dr. McKell Withers was also on hand to accept the check on behalf of teachers across the county.</p>\n<p>And it doesn’t stop here. For the entire month of May, SONIC guests and fans can make a difference in local communities by simply joining in the conversation online, celebrating teachers that have made a difference in their lives by using #ThanksTeach on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. For every post or share incorporating the hashtag, SONIC will donate funds towards teacher projects, up to $1 million.</p>\n<p>“Teachers see promise in their students that they can’t yet see in themselves. Nearly 50 years ago, Mrs. Pat Watson saw leadership potential in me when I was in junior high school that was further nurtured by high school teachers that set me on a course to grow into the leader that I am today,” said Cliff Hudson, Sonic Corp. CEO. “Today, we launch a new commitment to donate $15 million over the next five years to public school teachers and their students.”</p>\n<p>To learn more about #ThanksTeach and SONIC’s Limeades for Learning project, visit <a href="http://www.limeadesforlearning.com/">LimeadesforLearning.com</a> and explore local teacher projects that may be funded as a result of the campaign.

The leaders of the pack, the awesome administration team; which includes Greg Maughan (Principal), Sandra Buendia (Assistant Principal), Ken DeVries (Assistant Principal), and Jason Kirchner (Assistant Principal), prepared a “Leopard Prowl” for all of the incoming 9th grade students. This event welcomed them to East, it gave them an opportunity to familiarize themselves with the world-famous school, and it led up to the incoming freshman class attending their first-ever high school football game! It was a night full of good food, great company, and an amazing victory over the Syracuse Titans (67-21). It was a great day to be a leopard.</p>\n<p>The welcome-back festivities continued for the wise leopards of the pack, the outstanding faculty and staff at EHS. Again, the administration team put together a Friday-after-school barbecue to celebrate with its teachers the success of the first week of school. The event was perfect for everyone to relax and share fun back-to-school stories. It was a nice way to kick-start a new school year!

The certifications also represent substantial savings in energy costs.</p>\n<p>ENERGY STAR certification is earned when a building’s Energy Usage Intensity (EUI), energy used on a per-square foot basis, is in the top 25 percent of similar buildings throughout the nation. These buildings on average use 35 percent less energy and cause 35 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than similar buildings.</p>\n<p>The real benefit to the district and the community is the money saved by building safe, healthy, and energy efficient schools and then properly operating, maintaining, and improving them along the way. In 2009, district buildings consumed 34.4 million kilowatt hours (kWh). In 2014, consumption dropped to 29.6 million kWh, a 14 percent reduction. This reduction represents an annual savings of roughly $400,000. The corresponding environmental impact is equivalent to the removal of 3,840 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or the same amount produced by approximately 700 cars over the course of a year.</p>\n<p><img alt="" data-entity-type="" data-entity-uuid="" src="http://www.slcschools.org/news/2014-15/images/energy-usage.jpg" /></p>\n<p>It takes a team effort to produce such a large reduction in energy usage. District employees on every level have been involved. Examples of the district’s energy saving efforts include</p>\n<ul><li>Manually turning off lights whenever a classroom or office is not in use;</li>\n<li>Sealing gaps around doors and windows to make buildings more thermally efficient;</li>\n<li>Installing vacancy sensors to automatically control lights when rooms are not in use;</li>\n<li>Setting correct temperature points on thermostats and repairing faulty sensors in thermostats; and</li>\n<li>Using natural daylight to light classrooms instead of electricity.</li>\n</ul>	<p><strong>Salt Lake City School District Named Premier Member of the 2014</strong> <strong>ENERGY STAR Certification Nation</strong></p>	f	2015-03-23 09:39:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:18.596368-06	2017-09-19 13:11:02.594905-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Specifically, the district has advanced 17 elementary schools from bronze to silver level, added three silver and six bronze level secondary schools, and recertified nine bronze level elementary schools as part of the HUSSC initiative.</p>\n<p>The HealthierUS School Challenge is a voluntary certification initiative program run by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), recognizing those schools that have created healthier school environments through promotion of nutrition and physical activity. The initiative encourages all schools take a leadership role in helping students to make healthier eating and physical activity choices that will last a lifetime.</p>\n<p>To qualify for a HUSSC award, a school must submit a formal application and meet basic criteria set forth by the USDA. The HUSSC criteria reflect the recommendations of the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) published recommendations (April 2007) for foods that should be served outside of the organized school meals program. HealthierUS Schools must meet additional criteria demonstrating its commitment to a healthy school environment, as well as implement a local school wellness policy, as mandated by Congress. Schools receiving a HUSSC award commit to meeting the criteria throughout their four-year certification period.</p>\n	<p>The district has been recognized for having 35 of its 40 schools certified in the HealthierUS School Challenge.</p>\n	f	2016-04-06 09:10:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:12.430213-06	2017-09-19 13:10:50.35454-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

They are the subject of two picture books by Jory John, New York Times bestselling author and recipient of two E.B. White Read-Aloud Honors. </p>\n<p>Mr. John entertained the second and third graders at Bennion Elementary with his latest picture books. Penguin Problems tells the story of a penguin who doesn’t like cold weather, snow, short days, salty sea water, and just about everything else Antarctica has to offer. It was released last week. In Quit Calling Me a Monster! Floyd Peterson does not want to be called a monster. “Just because I have horns. And wild eyes. And clompy feet. And long toenails. And crazy hair. And fangs. And a huge, toothy smile that glows in the dark.” That doesn’t mean he wants to be labeled as a monster. </p>\n<p>From a few jots and doodles on a note card to a published book, Mr. John helped students understand the writing process. He showed the students slides of him working. From the produce section of the grocery store to the top on the slide at the park, his message to students was clear. “Where can writers can writers write?” he asked them. The answer, “EVERYWHERE!”</p>\n	<p>What do a disgruntled penguin and a misunderstood monster have in common?

The 2016 participants, a group of five highly respected educators from the United States, will embark to Geneva, Switzerland for a residential research experience for professional development.  They will join about 25 teachers from CERN member states for this professional development opportunity.</p>\n<p>Each year, K-12 educators are encouraged to apply for this one-of-a-kind professional development opportunity. Participants update their knowledge of particle physics, its associated technologies and related subjects and bring that knowledge back to their classrooms and communities. The participants will travel in July to Geneva, Switzerland and live there for 3 weeks. They will experience firsthand the research at the Center for European Nuclear Research (CERN). Led by expert CERN researchers, the Fellows will gain a wealth of knowledge to develop activities and lesson plans for their classrooms and to share with professional colleagues and communities upon returning home.</p>\n<p>“Our goals for teachers include a deeper understanding of physics content, an appreciation for the machinery of modern science, an introduction to inquiry-based teaching as well as evolution in individual teaching to a more student-centered mode of instruction.” Is the goal of QuarkNet, an association of physicists and teachers promoting particle physics education. Teachers will be mentored by center physicists, then they will create and develop experiments and lessons for students. </p>\n<p>This is the eighteenth year of the CERN HST Program, established to promote the education of particle physics in classrooms around the globe.   This project is sponsored in the United States by the National Science Foundation and run by the University of Michigan.</p>\n	<p>Enrique Arce-Larreta from West High School has been selected as one of this year’s CERN high school teacher program participants.</p>\n	f	2016-02-26 13:44:00-07	f	2017-08-30 10:41:13.08615-06	2017-09-19 13:10:51.49519-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Kindergarten teacher Heather Thomas read them Todd Parr's book "It's Okay to Be Different."  Afterwards, they discussed that it was okay for people to look different and like different things and that we should respect everybody no matter what. </p>\n<p>Then they created "All About Me" flags to celebrate their individuality. For this activity students drew a self-portrait in the middle of their flag. They had a class discussion about how each person has unique and individual characteristics such as different colored eyes, lengths of hair, etc. Students then got to draw a favorite animal, food, school activity, and family activity in the other areas of their flags. To complete the project, they painted the flags their own favorite colors.</p>\n<p>The capstone of the project was Celebration Day.  Students waived their flags around the classroom to music. When the music stopped, they looked for a partner and shared the things they liked on their flag with another student. This was repeated several times so we they were able to find out what many different people in the classroom liked. Each student's flag was individual and unique, and they waived their flags proudly. </p>\n	<p>Ensign Elementary kindergarten students celebrated their similarities and differences with a unique activity this fall.

This is our second year participating in the Achievement Via Individual Determination (AVID) program. This program is “dedicated to closing the achievement gap by preparing students for high school, college and a career." Teachers teach students skills and behaviors that will help them be successful in academics and provide a sense of hope for personal achievement through hard work. AVID has supports for helping students improve their writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization, and reading. Every student has a binder with color coded tabs/folders for each subject. Students use their binders as a reference for information about each subject and to help them stay organized. Students also have planners and homework folders to help them with time management and independence.</p>\n<p>We had a kick off assembly this week to introduce AVID to our students. We found out where each teacher graduated from college and asked several students what they want to be when they grow up. Teachers put on a skit to explain the importance of using planners, and each grade showed their organization tool for their classrooms. At the end of the assembly, we celebrated the fact that Parkview was the top performing Title I school for the 2016-17 school year and encouraged students to keep working hard. We’re looking forward to another great year of AVID!</p>\n<p><em>Author: Aly Miller, Parkview Elementary</em></p>\n	<p>There is a great energy at Parkview Elementary this year.

Research shows that children whose fathers take active roles in their educational lives earn better grades, score higher on tests, enjoy school more, and are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college.</p>\n	<p>Nibley Park School fathers walked their children to school on Tuesday morning as part of the national Million Father March initiative.</p>\n	f	2015-09-15 10:08:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:15.009388-06	2017-09-19 13:10:55.473123-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

While some school districts name only one teacher of the year, in Salt Lake City School District there are three Teacher of the Year Awards.</p>\n<p>The District Teacher of the Year award is open to all teachers in the district, and the winner of this award goes on to compete in the State Teacher of the Year competition. Over the past 7 years, Salt Lake City teachers have won the Utah Teacher of the Year competition four times. With the help of generous donors, the district also honors an Early Childhood Teacher of the Year and a Special Education Teacher of the Year.</p>\n<h3>2016 District Teacher of the Year - Doug Jorgensen</h3>\n<p>Doug Jorgensen has been teaching Biology at Highland High School for the past 19 years. In previous years, he has won the Golden Apple Award for Excellence in Education and the Kiwanis Outstanding Teacher Award. Jorgensen says he enjoys being a teacher because he loves to watch students succeed, not just academically but in all areas of their lives. He believes that an effective teacher needs to be motivated by a variety of factors, including love, trust, fairness, and improvement. One of his greatest rewards is to watch students go from shy, insecure children to blossoming confident young adults.</p>\n<h3>Early Childhood Teacher of the Year - Maria Swaim</h3>\n<p>Maria Swaim is a lead instructor in the district Early Childhood program. She has been working with the families and children of Salt Lake City since May 2000. Swaim works proactively to encourage parents to prepare their children for successful educations by enrolling in the district Early Childhood program. She exhibits cultural sensitivity and mutual respect for young children, their parents, and her colleagues and is highly respected by all.</p>\n<h3>Special Education Teacher of the Year - Allan Young</h3>\n<p>Allan Young is a highly respected Special Education teacher at Highland High School. He was nominated for this award because of his dedication to the growth and development of each and every student in his class. In addition to his dedication in the classroom, Young works tirelessly outside of the school to build community connections for his students. Young is an expert in establishing trust with the students and families he serves. The person who nominated Mr. Young said he is not only a teacher but has become part of the family’s life.</p>\n	<p>Salt Lake City School District is pleased to announce the 2016 District Teachers of the Year.</p>\n	f	2015-08-17 09:52:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:15.729651-06	2017-09-19 13:10:56.822375-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

They decided to visit Riley because Salt Lake City School District is considered a national leader in implementing practices that reduce the risks of pests and pesticides in its schools. In addition to receiving technical and grant support from the EPA, the district has been recognized for its participation in the IPM Star Certification program, a third-party certification program managed through the IPM Institute of North America. For more information: <a href="http://www.ipminstitute.org/ipmstar.htm">http://www.ipminstitute.org/ipmstar.htm</a></p>\n<p>IPM is a strategy for managing pests by using simple and effective principles that everyone can understand. In urban environments, IPM utilizes a combination of techniques including: education and communication, sanitation, maintenance and exclusion, and reduced-risk pesticides. For example, instead of using poisons to rid a school of mice, IPM practices educate custodians, kitchen staff, and teachers how to clean up their rooms and how to safely and securely store the food which would otherwise attract the mice.</p>\n<p>Riley Elementary is an excellent example of how successful and effective IMP practices can be. Zubiate said that over the last ten years, there has been only one application of pesticide at the school. It was small, targeted application to control a nest of wasps. Other than that, the school’s custodians and staff have been able keep their building clean and free of pests by using common sense strategies to reduce their sources of food, water and shelter.</p>\n	<p>Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Assistant Administrator Jim Jones toured Riley Elementary and gave certificates of appreciation to the school and the district’s Custodial Supervisor, Ricardo Zubiate, for their dedication to using Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices to keep schools clean and free of pesticides.</p>	f	2015-03-26 12:28:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:18.155194-06	2017-09-19 13:11:01.776011-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b

Below is a letter from the Utah State Office of Education announcing her selection...</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Congratulations Britnie!</p>\n<p>You have been selected as a Finalist for the Presidential Award for Excellence in Math and Science Teaching (PAEMST) for 2014 in the area of K-6 Science for the state of Utah.</p>\n<p>Earlier in the summer a panel of experts in science education reviewed the outstanding materials of K-6 science educators from across the state. There were many exemplary teachers who submitted materials, so you should be incredibly proud of your selection as a Utah Finalist for the 2014 year.</p>\n<p>The committee was impressed with the construction of your student-learning environment. The video clearly demonstrated and supported the narrative, showing the variety of instructional techniques and assessment used to support the student learning. The support for students and engagement aspects you exhibited were incredibly strong. From your use of open-ended discussion questions to the instructional choices based on student misconceptions, the committee was very impressed with your presentation of earth’s seasons in a way that was engaging, informative, and supportive of skill development.</p>\n<p>Your application packet has been submitted for review by a national selection committee. The White House will announce the results of the national selection process. The timing of the announcement depends largely on The White House schedule, but it is predicted to occur in the summer/fall of 2015. We will also be hosting a recognition dinner for you and the other finalists in the spring of 2015. We will be sending you details on that event at the start of the upcoming year.</p>\n<p>I have copied your supervisors on this announcement so that your community can celebrate your selection and recognize you as a finalist for this prestigious award.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for all that you do for excellence in science education, as you demonstrate outstanding teaching for your students, your school, and the state of Utah.</p>\n<p>Best wishes for your continued success.</p>\n	<p>Britnie Powell, a sixth-grade teacher at the Salt Lake Center for Science Education, has been selected as a finalist for the prestigious Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.

990	ff4d03d3-8963-42a1-bb96-a37b3d92b78d	Peer Assistance and Review Program	<p>Salt Lake City School District, in association with the Salt Lake Education Association, is piloting a unique and innovative program that is designed to help new teachers and veteran teachers in need of assistance. The Peer Assistance and Review (PAR) program is a result of the district's commitment to improve the quality of teachers in Salt Lake City. The program has been funded using state money for the last two years. The district was chosen to receive these funds to develop a program that could be replicated throughout Utah. The emerging results show the PAR program is successful in retaining quality teachers and identifying teachers who may be better suited for a different occupation.</p>\n<p>The PAR program is designed to promote effective instruction by providing guidance and support to both novice teachers and under-performing career teachers. A team of specially selected consulting teachers provide intensive support and mentoring to the novice and under-performing career teachers. Then, an objective panel of six people, including administrators and teachers, meet monthly to hear reports on teacher progress and make employment recommendations.</p>\n<p>During the 2013-14 school year, two consulting teachers provided support to 22 novice teachers and two career teachers, focusing on elementary schools. Twenty of the 22 novice teachers were welcomed back for the current school year and say they are now better prepared for a long career in education. In the 2014-15 school year, a third consulting teacher was added to work in secondary schools. A total of 35 novice teachers were part of the PAR program and five career teachers participated in the intervention process.</p>\n<p>PAR Coordinator Logan Hall says the program has led to an increase in the retention rate for novice teachers in the district. "We are now able to provide the kind of support we know first year teachers need in order to be successful, which is a critical component of ensuring teachers are capable of performing at the high expectations we have for quality education."</p>\n<p>In an anonymous survey assessing the value of the program, one teacher said, "My experience was fantastic - my consulting teacher was an indispensable resource. I would have struggled a lot more with teaching this year if she hadn't been there to help me navigate it."</p>\n<p>Preliminary survey data of the teachers who participated in the program this year shows they think it is a beneficial tool in helping them become more effective teachers. The district is working to expand the PAR program next year and make it available to all novice teachers in the district as well as more career teachers.</p>\n	<p>The district is  is piloting a unique and innovative program that is designed to help new teachers and veteran teachers in need of assistance.</p>\n	f	2015-06-23 10:04:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:16.156279-06	2017-09-19 13:10:57.787624-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b
986	be2d919c-bb15-4117-b490-ff1742508a6e	Bikes for Students in Salt Lake City	<p>The 69th Annual National Conference of the School Nutrition Association was held in Salt Lake City in mid-July. More than 6,000 school foodservice professionals attended the show.</p>\n<p>Schwan's Food Service had a strong contingent from its K12 team in attendance, working in the booth to exhibit and sample the many nutritious, great tasting foods for students. But the team decided that this year, they wanted to give back to the community that was hosting the event, and so they contacted Kelly Orton, the School Foodservice Director for the Salt Lake City School District.</p>\n<p>What resulted was a Sunday afternoon of fun with a purpose. Twenty-four of Schwan's team members gathered at the Radisson Hotel to build three youth and three teen-size road bikes. Over the course of several hours, stories were shared and tools were busy. Responsible for organizing the donation to the Salt Lake City School District were Kerrie Sprouse, SalesWest K12 Broker Rep and Kelly Orton.</p>\n<p>The bikes will be given away to six lucky students of the Salt Lake City School District during the 2015-2016 school season to celebrate school nutrition and healthy lifestyles.</p>\n<p>"We know the tremendous work that Kelly is doing in Salt Lake City - we see this reflected in districts across the country," said Leslie Napolitano, Director, West, Schwan's Food Service. "It's great to know that Kelly will raise the visibility of his strong program as he raffles the bikes this fall - and it makes us smile to know that six students will be enjoying our efforts."</p>\n	<p>During the recent School Nutrition national conference, Schwans donated six bicycles to the district. The bikes will be given to six lucky students this year.</p>\n	f	2015-08-06 11:49:00-06	f	2017-08-30 10:41:15.805224-06	2017-09-19 13:10:57.044303-06	t	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b	3d04d96e-bab3-4627-b7e7-93aedf36469b
